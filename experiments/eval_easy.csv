0,"what is the percentage change in the total debt from 2013 to 2014?","4.23%","<REASONING>
To calculate the percentage change in the total debt from 2013 to 2014, we can use the formula:

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 16625
new_value = 17328

percentage_change = ((17328 - 16625) / 16625) * 100

percentage_change = (703 / 16625) * 100

percentage_change = 0.0423 * 100

percentage_change = 4.23%

Therefore, the percentage change in the total debt from 2013 to 2014 is 4.23%.

1,"what is the net margin for 2006?","5.53%","<REASONING>
To calculate the net margin for 2006, we need to use the net income and total revenues from the given context. The net income for 2006 is $259.1 million, and the total revenues for 2006 are $24,587,777.

The net margin formula is:

net margin = (net income / total revenues) * 100

Substituting the given values:

net income = 259,100,000
total revenues = 24,587,777

net margin = (259,100,000 / 24,587,777) * 100

net margin = 1.053 * 100

net margin = 5.53%

Therefore, the net margin for 2006 is 5.53%.

revenues for the transaction processing services segment are derived from three main revenue channels ; enterprise solutions , integrated financial solutions and international .
revenues from transaction processing services totaled $ 2458.8 million , $ 1208.4 and $ 892.0 million for 2006 , 2005 and 2004 , respectively .
the overall segment increase of $ 1250.4 million during 2006 , as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to the certegy merger which contributed $ 1067.2 million to the overall increase .
the majority of the remaining 2006 growth is attributable to organic growth within the historically owned integrated financial solutions and international revenue channels , with international including $ 31.9 million related to the newly formed business process outsourcing operation in brazil .
the overall segment increase of $ 316.4 in 2005 as compared to 2004 results from the inclusion of a full year of results for the 2004 acquisitions of aurum , sanchez , kordoba , and intercept , which contributed $ 301.1 million of the increase .
cost of revenues for the transaction processing services segment totaled $ 1914.1 million , $ 904.1 million and $ 667.1 million for 2006 , 2005 and 2004 , respectively .
the overall segment increase of $ 1010.0 million during 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to the certegy merger which contributed $ 848.2 million to the increase .
gross profit as a percentage of revenues ( 201cgross margin 201d ) was 22.2% ( 22.2 % ) , 25.2% ( 25.2 % ) and 25.2% ( 25.2 % ) for 2006 , 2005 and 2004 , respectively .
the decrease in gross profit in 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily due to the february 1 , 2006 certegy merger , which businesses typically have lower margins than those of the historically owned fis businesses .
incremental intangible asset amortization relating to the certegy merger also contributed to the decrease in gross margin .
included in cost of revenues was depreciation and amortization of $ 272.4 million , $ 139.8 million , and $ 94.6 million for 2006 , 2005 and 2004 , respectively .
selling , general and administrative expenses totaled $ 171.1 million , $ 94.9 million and $ 99.6 million for 2006 , 2005 and 2004 , respectively .
the increase in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to the certegy merger which contributed $ 73.7 million to the overall increase of $ 76.2 million .
the decrease of $ 4.7 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 is primarily attributable to the effect of acquisition related costs in 2004 .
included in selling , general and administrative expenses was depreciation and amortization of $ 11.0 million , $ 9.1 million and $ 2.3 million for 2006 , 2005 and 2004 , respectively. .

To calculate the average of the beginning and end of year reserves, we can use the formula:

average = (beginning_of_year + end_of_year) / 2

Substituting the given values:

beginning_of_year = 421
end_of_year = 388

average = (421 + 388) / 2

average = 809 / 2

average = 404.5

Therefore, the average of the beginning and end of year reserves is 404.5 million barrels.

3,"what percent did cash flow from hedges reduce after reclassification?","-57.4%","<REASONING>
To calculate the percentage change in the cash flow hedges from 2014 to 2015, we can use the formula:

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 70.1 (cash flow hedges balance as of December 31, 2014)
new_value = 29.8 (cash flow hedges balance as of December 31, 2015)

percentage_change = ((29.8 - 70.1) / 70.1) * 100

percentage_change = (-40.3 / 70.1) * 100

percentage_change = -0.574 * 100

percentage_change = -57.4%

Therefore, the percentage change in the cash flow hedges from 2014 to 2015 is -57.4%.

in addition , the merger notes and the 3.375% ( 3.375 % ) senior notes due 2021 may be redeemed at our option without any make-whole premium at specified dates ranging from one month to six months in advance of the scheduled maturity date .
between the closing date and june 30 , 2015 , we repaid the biomet senior notes we assumed in the merger .
the fair value of the principal amount plus interest was $ 2798.6 million .
these senior notes required us to pay a call premium in excess of the fair value of the notes when they were repaid .
as a result , we recognized $ 22.0 million in non-operating other expense related to this call premium .
the estimated fair value of our senior notes as of december 31 , 2015 , based on quoted prices for the specific securities from transactions in over-the-counter markets ( level 2 ) , was $ 8837.5 million .
the estimated fair value of the japan term loan as of december 31 , 2015 , based upon publicly available market yield curves and the terms of the debt ( level 2 ) , was $ 96.4 million .
the carrying value of the u.s .
term loan approximates fair value as it bears interest at short-term variable market rates .
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements which we designated as fair value hedges of underlying fixed- rate obligations on our senior notes due 2019 and 2021 .
see note 14 for additional information regarding the interest rate swap agreements .
we also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $ 35.8 million .
at december 31 , 2015 and 2014 , the weighted average interest rate for our long-term borrowings was 2.9 percent and 3.5 percent , respectively .
we paid $ 207.1 million , $ 67.5 million and $ 68.1 million in interest during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively .

accumulated other comprehensive ( loss ) income oci refers to certain gains and losses that under gaap are included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net earnings as these amounts are initially recorded as an adjustment to stockholders 2019 equity .
amounts in oci may be reclassified to net earnings upon the occurrence of certain events .
our oci is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments , unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges , unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities , and amortization of prior service costs and unrecognized gains and losses in actuarial assumptions on our defined benefit plans .
foreign currency translation adjustments are reclassified to net earnings upon sale or upon a complete or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign entity .
unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges are reclassified to net earnings when the hedged item affects net earnings .
unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are reclassified to net earnings if we sell the security before maturity or if the unrealized loss is considered to be other-than-temporary .
amounts related to defined benefit plans that are in oci are reclassified over the service periods of employees in the plan .
the reclassification amounts are allocated to all employees in the plans and , therefore , the reclassified amounts may become part of inventory to the extent they are considered direct labor costs .
see note 15 for more information on our defined benefit plans .

in addition , the merger notes and the 3.375% ( 3.375 % ) senior notes due 2021 may be redeemed at our option without any make-whole premium at specified dates ranging from one month to six months in advance of the scheduled maturity date .
between the closing date and june 30 , 2015 , we repaid the biomet senior notes we assumed in the merger .
the fair value of the principal amount plus interest was $ 2798.6 million .
these senior notes required us to pay a call premium in excess of the fair value of the notes when they were repaid .
as a result , we recognized $ 22.0 million in non-operating other expense related to this call premium .
the estimated fair value of our senior notes as of december 31 , 2015 , based on quoted prices for the specific securities from transactions in over-the-counter markets ( level 2 ) , was $ 8837.5 million .
the estimated fair value of the japan term loan as of december 31 , 2015 , based upon publicly available market yield curves and the terms of the debt ( level 2 ) , was $ 96.4 million .
the carrying value of the u.s .
term loan approximates fair value as it bears interest at short-term variable market rates .
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements which we designated as fair value hedges of underlying fixed- rate obligations on our senior notes due 2019 and 2021 .
see note 14 for additional information regarding the interest rate swap agreements .
we also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $ 35.8 million .
at december 31 , 2015 and 2014 , the weighted average interest rate for our long-term borrowings was 2.9 percent and 3.5 percent , respectively .

accumulated other comprehensive ( loss ) income oci refers to certain gains and losses that under gaap are included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net earnings as these amounts are initially recorded as an adjustment to stockholders 2019 equity .
amounts in oci may be reclassified to net earnings upon the occurrence of certain events .
our oci is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments , unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges , unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities , and amortization of prior service costs and unrecognized gains and losses in actuarial assumptions on our defined benefit plans .
foreign currency translation adjustments are reclassified to net earnings upon sale or upon a complete or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign entity .
unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges are reclassified to net earnings when the hedged item affects net earnings .
unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are reclassified to net earnings if we sell the security before maturity or if the unrealized loss is considered to be other-than-temporary .
amounts related to defined benefit plans that are in oci are reclassified over the service periods of employees in the plan .
the reclassification amounts are allocated to all employees in the plans and , therefore , the reclassified amounts may become part of inventory to the extent they are considered direct labor costs .
see note 15 for more information on our defined benefit plans .

4,"in 2004 what was the net change in cash","$2310","<REASONING>
To find the net change in cash for 2004, we need to look at the cash flow statement provided in the context. The relevant table from the statement is:

| cash flow | 2004 | 2003 | 2002 |
|-----------|------|------|------|
| net cash provided by operating activities | $2634 | $3896 | $2577 |
| net cash used for investing activities | -$2401 (2401) | -$8387 (8387) | -$6600 (6600) |
| net cash provided by financing activities | $477 | $4608 | $4037 |
| cash end of year | $1148 | $462 | $377 |

The net change in cash is the difference between the cash at the beginning of the year and the cash at the end of the year. However, the cash at the beginning of the year is not provided in the context. But we can calculate the net change in cash by looking at the net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used for investing activities, and net cash provided by financing activities.

The net change in cash for 2004 can be calculated as follows:

net change in cash = net cash provided by operating activities + net cash used for investing activities + net cash provided by financing activities

Substituting the given values:

net change in cash = 2634 + (-2401) + 477

net change in cash = 2634 - 2401 + 477

net change in cash = 2310

Therefore, the net change in cash for 2004 is $2310.

5,"in 2004 what was the percent of the hartford declared dividends that was paid to shareholders i","98.18%","<REASONING>
To find the percentage of the Hartford declared dividends that was paid to shareholders in 2004, we need to first determine the total declared dividends and the total paid dividends in 2004. 

From the context, we can see that the Hartford declared a dividend on its common stock of $0.29 per share payable on January 3, 2005, to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2004. However, the total declared and paid dividends in 2004 are not directly provided in the context. 

We can find the total declared dividends in 2004 by looking at the table provided in the context. The table shows the cash flow for 2004, 2003, and 2002. Under the ""net cash provided by financing activities,"" we can see that the Hartford declared $331 in dividends in 2004.

To find the total paid dividends in 2004, we also look at the table provided in the context. Under the ""net cash used for investing activities,"" we can see that the Hartford paid $325 in dividends in 2004.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the Hartford declared dividends that was paid to shareholders in 2004.

percentage_paid = (total_paid_dividends / total_declared_dividends) * 100

Substituting the given values:

total_declared_dividends = $331
total_paid_dividends = $325

percentage_paid = ($325 / $331) * 100

percentage_paid = 0.9818 * 100

percentage_paid = 98.18%

Therefore, the percentage of the Hartford declared dividends that was paid to shareholders in 2004 is 98.18%.

2004 compared to 2003 2014 cash from operating activities primarily reflects premium cash flows in excess of claim payments .
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the $ 1.15 billion settlement of the macarthur litigation in 2004 .
cash provided by financing activities decreased primarily due to lower proceeds from investment and universal life-type contracts as a result of the adoption of sop 03-1 , decreased capital raising activities , repayment of commercial paper and early retirement of junior subordinated debentures in 2004 .
the decrease in cash from financing activities and operating cash flows invested long-term accounted for the majority of the change in cash used for investing activities .
2003 compared to 2002 2014 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of strong premium cash flows .
financing activities increased primarily due to capital raising activities related to the 2003 asbestos reserve addition and decreased due to repayments on long-term debt and lower proceeds from investment and universal life-type contracts .
the increase in cash from financing activities accounted for the majority of the change in cash used for investing activities .

6,"what is the principal payment in 2017 as a percentage of the total senior secured transition bonds?","8.37%","<REASONING>
To calculate the principal payment in 2017 as a percentage of the total senior secured transition bonds, we need to first find the total principal payment in 2017 and the total amount of the senior secured transition bonds.

From the context, we can see that the principal payments for the senior secured transition bonds are as follows:

- Tranche A-1: $93,500 due in 2013
- Tranche A-2: $121,600 due in 2018
- Tranche A-3: $11,440,000 due in 2017, $11,000,000 due in 2018, $11,200,000 due in 2019, $11,600,000 due in 2020

The total principal payment in 2017 is $27,600,000, which is the sum of $23,600,000 for Tranche A-2 and $4,000,000 for Tranche A-3.

The total amount of the senior secured transition bonds is $329,500,000.

Now, we can calculate the principal payment in 2017 as a percentage of the total senior secured transition bonds:

percentage = (principal payment in 2017 / total senior secured transition bonds) * 100

percentage = ($27,600,000 / $329,500,000) * 100

percentage = 0.0837 * 100

percentage = 8.37%

Therefore, the principal payment in 2017 as a percentage of the total senior secured transition bonds is 8.37%.

8,"what is the roi of an investment in s&p500 from 2006 to 2007?","82.87%","<REASONING>
To calculate the return on investment (ROI) of an investment in the S&P 500 from 2006 to 2007, we need to first determine the total return of the S&P 500 for the given period. The total return is calculated as the sum of the capital appreciation and the dividend yield.

From the provided context, we can see that the values for the S&P 500 index for the given period are as follows:

- December 28, 2002: 100.00
- January 3, 2004: 128.68
- January 1, 2005: 142.69
- December 31, 2005: 149.70
- December 30, 2006: 173.34
- December 29, 2007: 182.87

To calculate the total return, we can use the formula:

total_return = (end_value / start_value) - 1

Substituting the given values:

start_value = 100.00 (December 28, 2002)
end_value = 182.87 (December 29, 2007)

total_return = (182.87 / 100.00) - 1
total_return = 1.8287 - 1
total_return = 0.8287

Therefore, the total return of the S&P 500 from 2006 to 2007 is 82.87%.

To calculate the ROI, we need to know the initial investment amount. However, the context does not provide this information. Therefore, we cannot calculate the ROI without this information.

However, we can calculate the ROI if we assume an initial investment amount of $100. In this case, the ROI would be:

ROI = (total_return * 100) / initial_investment
ROI = (0.8287 * 100) / 100
ROI = 82.87%

Therefore, the ROI of an investment in the S&P 500 from 2006 to 2007, assuming an initial investment of $100, is 82.87%.

                To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

                percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = (58620 / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = 0.2931 * 100

                percentage_change = 29.31%

                Therefore, the percentage change in the net cash from operating activities from 2008 to 2009 is 29.31%.

9,"what is the average yearly amortization rate related to purchased technology?","6","<REASONING>
To find the average yearly amortization rate related to purchased technology, we need to look at the weighted average useful life of purchased technology from the provided context.

From the context, we can see that the weighted average useful life of purchased technology is 6 years.

To find the average yearly amortization rate, we can divide the weighted average useful life by the number of years. However, since the weighted average useful life is already given in years, we can directly use it as the average yearly amortization rate for purchased technology.

Therefore, the average yearly amortization rate related to purchased technology is 6 years.

To determine whether the weighted average useful life of purchased technology is greater than customer contracts and relationships, we need to compare the weighted average useful life of purchased technology with the weighted average useful life of customer contracts and relationships.

From the provided context, we can see that the weighted average useful life of purchased technology is 6 years, and the weighted average useful life of customer contracts and relationships is 10 years.

Therefore, the weighted average useful life of customer contracts and relationships is greater than the weighted average useful life of purchased technology.

11,"what portion of the total other expenses is related to securities processing in 2007?","16.55%","<REASONING>
To find the portion of the total other expenses related to securities processing in 2007, we can use the data provided in the context.

From the table in the context, we can see that the total other expenses in 2007 were $478 million, and the expenses related to securities processing were $79 million.

To find the portion of the total other expenses related to securities processing, we can divide the expenses related to securities processing by the total other expenses and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

portion = (expenses related to securities processing / total other expenses) * 100
portion = ($79 / $478) * 100
portion = 0.1655 * 100
portion = 16.55%

Therefore, the portion of the total other expenses related to securities processing in 2007 is 16.55%.

To find the portion of the total other expenses related to customer indemnification obligation in 2008, we can use the information provided in the context.

From the table in the context, we can see that the total other expenses in 2008 were $892 million, and the customer indemnification obligation was $200 million.

To find the portion of the total other expenses related to customer indemnification obligation, we can divide the customer indemnification obligation by the total other expenses:

portion = customer indemnification obligation / total other expenses

Substituting the given values:

portion = $200 million / $892 million

portion = 0.2237

To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100:

portion = 0.2237 * 100

portion = 22.37%

Therefore, the portion of the total other expenses related to customer indemnification obligation in 2008 is 22.37%.

13,"containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers decreased by how many tons in the year ended december 31 , 2003 from 2002?","6.7%","<REASONING>
To find the decrease in containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers from 2002 to 2003, we can use the information provided in the context.

From the table, we can see that the containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers was 477,000 tons in 2002 and 445,000 tons in 2003.

To find the decrease, we can subtract the 2003 value from the 2002 value:

477,000 tons (2002) - 445,000 tons (2003) = 32,000 tons

Therefore, the containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers decreased by 32,000 tons from 2002 to 2003.

However, the question asks for the decrease as a percentage, so we need to calculate the percentage decrease:

Percentage decrease = (Decrease / Original value) * 100
= (32,000 tons / 477,000 tons) * 100
= 0.067 * 100
= 6.7%

Therefore, the containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers decreased by 6.7% in the year ended December 31, 2003, from 2002.

other expense , net , decreased $ 6.2 million , or 50.0% ( 50.0 % ) , for the year ended december 31 , 2004 compared to the year ended december 31 , 2003 .
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in charges on disposal and transfer costs of fixed assets and facility closure costs of $ 3.3 million , reduced legal charges of $ 1.5 million , and a reduction in expenses of $ 1.4 million consisting of individually insignificant items .
interest expense and income taxes interest expense decreased in 2004 by $ 92.2 million , or 75.7% ( 75.7 % ) , from 2003 .
this decrease included $ 73.3 million of expenses related to the company 2019s debt refinancing , which was completed in july 2003 .
the $ 73.3 million of expenses consisted of $ 55.9 million paid in premiums for the tender of the 95 20448% ( 20448 % ) senior subordinated notes , and a $ 17.4 million non-cash charge for the write-off of deferred financing fees related to the 95 20448% ( 20448 % ) notes and pca 2019s original revolving credit facility .
excluding the $ 73.3 million charge , interest expense was $ 18.9 million lower than in 2003 as a result of lower interest rates attributable to the company 2019s july 2003 refinancing and lower debt levels .
pca 2019s effective tax rate was 38.0% ( 38.0 % ) for the year ended december 31 , 2004 and 42.3% ( 42.3 % ) for the year ended december 31 , 2003 .
the higher tax rate in 2003 is due to stable permanent items over lower book income ( loss ) .
for both years 2004 and 2003 tax rates are higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% ( 35.0 % ) due to state income taxes .

net sales net sales decreased by $ 0.4 million , or 0.0% ( 0.0 % ) , for the year ended december 31 , 2003 from the year ended december 31 , 2002 .
net sales increased due to improved sales volumes compared to 2002 , however , this increase was entirely offset by lower sales prices .
total corrugated products volume sold increased 2.1% ( 2.1 % ) to 28.1 billion square feet in 2003 compared to 27.5 billion square feet in 2002 .
on a comparable shipment-per-workday basis , corrugated products sales volume increased 1.7% ( 1.7 % ) in 2003 from 2002 .

To calculate the percentage point change in PCA's effective tax rate from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004, we can use the formula:

percentage_point_change = new_value - old_value

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 42.3% (effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2003)
new_value = 38.0% (effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004)

percentage_point_change = 38.0% - 42.3%

Therefore, the percentage point change in PCA's effective tax rate from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004 is -4.3%.

other expense , net , decreased $ 6.2 million , or 50.0% ( 50.0 % ) , for the year ended december 31 , 2004 compared to the year ended december 31 , 2003 .
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in charges on disposal and transfer costs of fixed assets and facility closure costs of $ 3.3 million , reduced legal charges of $ 1.5 million , and a reduction in expenses of $ 1.4 million consisting of individually insignificant items .
interest expense and income taxes interest expense decreased in 2004 by $ 92.2 million , or 75.7% ( 75.7 % ) , from 2003 .
this decrease included $ 73.3 million of expenses related to the company 2019s debt refinancing , which was completed in july 2003 .
the $ 73.3 million of expenses consisted of $ 55.9 million paid in premiums for the tender of the 95 20448% ( 20448 % ) senior subordinated notes , and a $ 17.4 million non-cash charge for the write-off of deferred financing fees related to the 95 20448% ( 20448 % ) notes and pca 2019s original revolving credit facility .
excluding the $ 73.3 million charge , interest expense was $ 18.9 million lower than in 2003 as a result of lower interest rates attributable to the company 2019s july 2003 refinancing and lower debt levels .

15,"what is the net change in the balance of total liabilities for litigation settlements during 2007?","$16,259,000,000","<REASONING>
To find the net change in the balance of total liabilities for litigation settlements during 2007, we need to look at the opening balance of total liabilities for litigation settlements at the beginning of 2007 and the closing balance at the end of 2007. 

From the provided context, the opening balance as of December 31, 2006, is $477 million. 

The changes to the balance during 2007 are as follows:

- Provision for litigation settlements (note 20): $3 million
- Interest accretion on U.S. merchant lawsuit: $38 million
- Payments: -$114 million
- Provision for discover settlement: $863 million
- Provision for American Express settlement: $16,490 million
- Provision for other litigation settlements: $6 million
- Interest accretion on U.S. merchant lawsuit: $33 million
- Interest accretion on American Express settlement: $44 million
- Payments on American Express settlement: -$300 million
- Payments on discover settlement: -$863 million
- Payment on U.S. merchant lawsuit: -$100 million
- Other payments and accretion: -$1 million

To find the net change, we need to sum up all these changes. 

Net change = ($477 + $3 + $38 - $114 + $863 + $16,490 + $6 + $33 + $44 - $300 - $863 - $100 - $1)

Net change = $16,736 - $477

Net change = $16,259 million

Therefore, the net change in the balance of total liabilities for litigation settlements during 2007 is $16,259 million.

contribution expense 2014foundation in may 2006 , in conjunction with our initial public offering ( 201cipo 201d ) , we issued 13496933 shares of our class a common stock as a donation to the foundation that is incorporated in canada and controlled by directors who are independent of us and our customers .
the foundation builds on mastercard 2019s existing charitable giving commitments by continuing to support programs and initiatives that help children and youth to access education , understand and utilize technology , and develop the skills necessary to succeed in a diverse and global work force .
the vision of the foundation is to make the economy work for everybody by advancing innovative programs in areas of microfinance and youth education .
in connection with the donation of the class a common stock , we recorded an expense of $ 395 million which was equal to the aggregate value of the shares we donated .
in both 2007 and 2006 , we recorded expenses of $ 20 million for cash donations we made to the foundation , completing our intention , announced at the time of the ipo , to donate approximately $ 40 million in cash to the foundation in support of its operating expenses and charitable disbursements for the first four years of its operations .
we may make additional cash contributions to the foundation in the future .
the cash and stock donations to the foundation are generally not deductible by mastercard for tax purposes .
as a result of this difference between the financial statement and tax treatments of the donations , our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 , 2006 is significantly higher than our effective income tax rates for 2007 and 2008 .
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses increased $ 14 million in 2008 and decreased $ 2 million in 2007 .
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2008 is primarily due to increased investments in leasehold and building improvements , data center equipment and capitalized software .
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2007 was primarily related to certain assets becoming fully depreciated .
depreciation and amortization will increase as we continue to invest in leasehold and building improvements , data center equipment and capitalized software. .

To find the net change in the balance of total liabilities for litigation settlements during 2008, we need to look at the table provided in the context. The table shows the changes in the balance of total liabilities for litigation settlements from December 31, 2006, to December 31, 2008.

From the table, we can see that the balance as of December 31, 2006, was $477. Then, there were various provisions and interest accretion added, and payments were made. Finally, the balance as of December 31, 2007, was $404.

To find the net change from 2006 to 2007, we can subtract the balance as of December 31, 2006, from the balance as of December 31, 2007:

$404 (balance as of December 31, 2007) - $477 (balance as of December 31, 2006) = -$73

However, the question asks for the net change in the balance of total liabilities for litigation settlements during 2008. To find this, we need to look at the changes from December 31, 2007, to December 31, 2008.

From the table, we can see that the balance as of December 31, 2007, was $404. Then, there were various provisions and interest accretion added, and payments were made. Finally, the balance as of December 31, 2008, was $1736.

To find the net change from 2007 to 2008, we can subtract the balance as of December 31, 2007, from the balance as of December 31, 2008:

$1736 (balance as of December 31, 2008) - $404 (balance as of December 31, 2007) = $1332

Therefore, the net change in the balance of total liabilities for litigation settlements during 2008 is $1332.

            <CONTEXT>
            In 2008, the net cash from operating activities was $200,000.

            <REASONING>
                To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

                percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = (58620 / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = 0.2931 * 100

                percentage_change = 29.31%

                Therefore, the percentage change in the net cash from operating activities from 2008 to 2009 is 29.31%.

contribution expense 2014foundation in may 2006 , in conjunction with our initial public offering ( 201cipo 201d ) , we issued 13496933 shares of our class a common stock as a donation to the foundation that is incorporated in canada and controlled by directors who are independent of us and our customers .
the foundation builds on mastercard 2019s existing charitable giving commitments by continuing to support programs and initiatives that help children and youth to access education , understand and utilize technology , and develop the skills necessary to succeed in a diverse and global work force .
the vision of the foundation is to make the economy work for everybody by advancing innovative programs in areas of microfinance and youth education .
in connection with the donation of the class a common stock , we recorded an expense of $ 395 million which was equal to the aggregate value of the shares we donated .
in both 2007 and 2006 , we recorded expenses of $ 20 million for cash donations we made to the foundation , completing our intention , announced at the time of the ipo , to donate approximately $ 40 million in cash to the foundation in support of its operating expenses and charitable disbursements for the first four years of its operations .
we may make additional cash contributions to the foundation in the future .
the cash and stock donations to the foundation are generally not deductible by mastercard for tax purposes .
as a result of this difference between the financial statement and tax treatments of the donations , our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 , 2006 is significantly higher than our effective income tax rates for 2007 and 2008 .
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses increased $ 14 million in 2008 and decreased $ 2 million in 2007 .
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2008 is primarily due to increased investments in leasehold and building improvements , data center equipment and capitalized software .
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2007 was primarily related to certain assets becoming fully depreciated .
depreciation and amortization will increase as we continue to invest in leasehold and building improvements , data center equipment and capitalized software. .

    The context provided includes information about various financial items for the years 2006, 2007, and 2008, but it does not provide a clear indication of the rental income for those years. The relevant information is found in a table within the context, which lists rental income for the years 2006, 2007, and 2008 as $83 million, $68 million, and $87 million, respectively.

    To calculate the percentage change in rental income from 2007 to 2008, we can use the formula:

    percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

    Substituting the given values:

    old_value = 68,000,000
    new_value = 87,000,000

    percentage_change = ((87,000,000 - 68,000,000) / 68,000,000) * 100

    percentage_change = (19,000,000 / 68,000,000) * 100

The context provided includes information about the total rent charged to operating expense for 2016, 2015, and 2014. The relevant information is as follows:

- Total rent charged to operating expense for 2016: $244 million
- Total rent charged to operating expense for 2015: $249 million
- Total rent charged to operating expense for 2014: $309 million

To find the total rent charged to operating expense for 2016, 2015, and 2014, we simply need to add the given values:

Total rent charged to operating expense = $244 million + $249 million + $309 million

Total rent charged to operating expense = $802 million

Therefore, the total rent charged to operating expense in millions for 2016, 2015, and 2014 is $802 million.

                To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

                percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = (58620 / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = 0.2931 * 100

                percentage_change = 29.31%

20,"what is the growth rate in the average price of the purchased shares from october to december 2014?","7.82%","<REASONING>
To calculate the growth rate in the average price of the purchased shares from October to December 2014, we need to find the average price for each period and then calculate the percentage change from the first period to the last period.

The table provided shows the total number of shares purchased and the average price paid per share for each period.

For the period from September 29, 2014, to October 26, 2014:
- Total number of shares purchased: 399,259
- Average price paid per share: $176.96

For the period from October 27, 2014, to November 30, 2014:
- Total number of shares purchased: 504,300
- Average price paid per share: $187.74

For the period from December 1, 2014, to December 31, 2014:
- Total number of shares purchased: 365,683
- Average price paid per share: $190.81

To find the growth rate, we will calculate the percentage change from the first period to the last period.

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:
old_value = $176.96
new_value = $190.81

percentage_change = (($190.81 - $176.96) / $176.96) * 100

percentage_change = ($13.85 / $176.96) * 100

percentage_change = 0.0782 * 100

percentage_change = 7.82%

Therefore, the growth rate in the average price of the purchased shares from October to December 2014 is 7.82%.

21,"considering the years 2012 and 2013 , what is the increase observed in the balance at the end of the year?","$13.5","<REASONING>
    The question asks for the increase observed in the balance at the end of the year for unrecognized tax benefits from 2012 to 2013. We can find this information in the table provided in the context.

    The balance at the end of 2012 is $110.8 and the balance at the end of 2013 is $124.3.

    To find the increase, we subtract the balance at the end of 2012 from the balance at the end of 2013:

    increase = balance at the end of 2013 - balance at the end of 2012
    increase = $124.3 - $110.8
    increase = $13.5

    Therefore, the increase observed in the balance at the end of the year for unrecognized tax benefits from 2012 to 2013 is $13.5.

at 30 september 2013 and 2012 , we had $ 124.3 and $ 110.8 of unrecognized tax benefits , excluding interest and penalties , of which $ 63.1 and $ 56.9 , respectively , would impact the effective tax rate if recognized .
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as a component of income tax expense and totaled $ 2.4 in 2013 , $ ( 26.1 ) in 2012 , and $ ( 2.4 ) in 2011 .
our accrued balance for interest and penalties was $ 8.1 and $ 7.2 in 2013 and 2012 , respectively .
we were challenged by the spanish tax authorities over income tax deductions taken by certain of our spanish subsidiaries during fiscal years 2005 20132011 .
in november 2011 , we reached a settlement with the spanish tax authorities for 20ac41.3 million ( $ 56 ) in resolution of all tax issues under examination .
this settlement increased our income tax expense for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2012 by $ 43.8 ( $ .20 per share ) and had a 3.3% ( 3.3 % ) impact on our effective tax rate .
as a result of this settlement , we recorded a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $ 6.4 for tax positions taken in prior years and $ 11.0 for settlements .
on 25 january 2012 , the spanish supreme court released its decision in favor of our spanish subsidiary related to certain tax transactions for years 1991 and 1992 , a period before we controlled this subsidiary .
as a result , in the second quarter of 2012 , we recorded a reduction in income tax expense of $ 58.3 ( $ .27 per share ) , resulting in a 4.4% ( 4.4 % ) reduction in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2012 .
as a result of this ruling , we recorded a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $ 38.3 for tax positions taken in prior years .
during the third quarter of 2012 , our unrecognized tax benefits increased $ 33.3 as a result of certain tax positions taken in conjunction with the disposition of our homecare business .
when resolved , these benefits will be recognized in 201cincome from discontinued operations , net of tax 201d on our consolidated income statements and will not impact our effective tax rate .
for additional information , see note 3 , discontinued operations .
in the third quarter of 2011 , a u.s .
internal revenue service audit over tax years 2007 and 2008 was completed , resulting in a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $ 36.0 and a favorable impact to earnings of $ 23.9 .
this included a tax benefit of $ 8.9 ( $ .04 per share ) recognized in income from discontinued operations for fiscal year 2011 , as it relates to the previously divested u.s .
healthcare business .
we are also currently under examination in a number of tax jurisdictions , some of which may be resolved in the next twelve months .
as a result , it is reasonably possible that a change in the unrecognized tax benefits may occur during the next twelve months .
however , quantification of an estimated range cannot be made at this time. .

our losses from future catastrophic events could exceed our projections .
we use projections of possible losses from future catastrophic events of varying types and magnitudes as a strategic underwriting tool .
we use these loss projections to estimate our potential catastrophe losses in certain geographic areas and decide on the placement of retrocessional coverage or other actions to limit the extent of potential losses in a given geographic area .
these loss projections are approximations , reliant on a mix of quantitative and qualitative processes , and actual losses may exceed the projections by a material amount , resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. .

To find the total Texas facilities square footage, we need to sum up the square footage of all the facilities located in Texas from the provided table data.

From the table, we can see that there are two facilities in Texas: Waco Texas and Longview Texas (c).

The square footage of Waco Texas is 666000 square feet and Longview Texas (c) is 63,000 square feet.

Therefore, the total Texas facilities square footage is 666000 + 63,000 = 729,000 square feet.

Additionally, there is another facility in Texas, Seguin Texas (c), which is also owned by the company. The square footage of Seguin Texas (c) is 71,000 square feet.

So, the total Texas facilities square footage is 729,000 + 71,000 = 800,000 square feet.

24,"what was the percent of the change in the aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt obligations for the citigroup parent company from 2010 to 2011","2.24%","<REASONING>
To calculate the percentage change in the aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt obligations for the Citigroup parent company from 2010 to 2011, we can use the formula:

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 18030 (in millions of dollars)
new_value = 20435 (in millions of dollars)

percentage_change = ((20435 - 18030) / 18030) * 100

percentage_change = (405 / 18030) * 100

percentage_change = 0.0224 * 100

percentage_change = 2.24%

Therefore, the percentage change in the aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt obligations for the Citigroup parent company from 2010 to 2011 is 2.24%.

To calculate the percentage change in excess central bank balances from 2016 to 2017, we can use the formula:

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

old_value = 48407
new_value = 33584

percentage_change = ((33584 - 48407) / 48407) * 100

percentage_change = (-14823 / 48407) * 100

with respect to highly liquid short-term investments presented in the preceding table , due to the continued elevated level of client deposits as of december 31 , 2017 , we maintained cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements governing deposits with the federal reserve of approximately $ 33.58 billion at the federal reserve , the ecb and other non-u.s .
central banks , compared to $ 48.40 billion as of december 31 , 2016 .
the lower levels of deposits with central banks as of december 31 , 2017 compared to december 31 , 2016 was due to normal deposit volatility .
liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without corresponding advances from the frbb , the fhlb , and other non- u.s .
central banks .
state street bank is a member of the fhlb .
this membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against high-quality collateral , which helps facilitate asset-and-liability management .
access to primary , intra-day and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying conditions .
as of december 31 , 2017 and december 31 , 2016 , we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the frbb discount window or any other central bank facility , and as of the same dates , no fhlb advances were outstanding .
in addition to the securities included in our asset liquidity , we have significant amounts of other unencumbered investment securities .
the aggregate fair value of those securities was $ 66.10 billion as of december 31 , 2017 , compared to $ 54.40 billion as of december 31 , 2016 .
these securities are available sources of liquidity , although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our asset liquidity .
measures of liquidity include lcr , nsfr and tlac which are described in ""supervision and regulation"" included under item 1 , business , of this form 10-k .
uses of liquidity significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following : withdrawals of client deposits ; draw- downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit or to purchase securities , generally provided through lines of credit ; and short-duration advance facilities .
such circumstances would generally arise under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings .
a recurring significant use of our liquidity involves our deployment of hqla from our investment portfolio to post collateral to financial institutions and participants in our agency lending program serving as sources of securities under our enhanced custody program .
we had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual amounts totaling $ 26.49 billion and $ 26.99 billion as of december 31 , 2017 and december 31 , 2016 , respectively .
these amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral .
as of december 31 , 2017 , approximately 72% ( 72 % ) of our unfunded commitments to extend credit expire within one year .
since many of our commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon , the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements .
information about our resolution planning and the impact actions under our resolution plans could have on our liquidity is provided in ""supervision and regulation"" included under item 1 .
business , of this form 10-k .
funding deposits we provide products and services including custody , accounting , administration , daily pricing , foreign exchange services , cash management , financial asset management , securities finance and investment advisory services .
as a provider of these products and services , we generate client deposits , which have generally provided a stable , low-cost source of funds .
as a global custodian , clients place deposits with state street entities in various currencies .
as of december 31 , 2017 and december 31 , 2016 , approximately 60% ( 60 % ) of our average client deposit balances were denominated in u.s .
dollars , approximately 20% ( 20 % ) in eur , 10% ( 10 % ) in gbp and 10% ( 10 % ) in all other currencies .
for the past several years , we have frequently experienced higher client deposit inflows toward the end of each fiscal quarter or the end of the fiscal year .
as a result , we believe average client deposit balances are more reflective of ongoing funding than period-end balances. .

26,"assuming that all cash , cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested to generate the stated interest income in 2014 , what would be the average interest rate?","1.64%","<REASONING>
To calculate the average interest rate, we need to determine the total interest income and the total amount of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Then, we can use the formula:

average_interest_rate = (total_interest_income / total_amount) * 100

From the context, we can see that the total interest income in 2014 was $27.4 million. The total amount of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2014, was $1667.2 million.

Substituting the given values:

total_interest_income = 27.4
total_amount = 1667.2

average_interest_rate = (27.4 / 1667.2) * 100

average_interest_rate = 0.0164 * 100

average_interest_rate = 1.64%

Therefore, the average interest rate, assuming that all cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are invested to generate the stated interest income in 2014, would be 1.64%.

28,"based on the table , how much percent did the healthcare sector outperform the overall market in this 5 year period?","18%","To calculate the percentage by which the healthcare sector outperformed the overall market in this 5-year period, we need to compare the cumulative total stockholder returns of the S&P 500 Healthcare Equipment & Supply Index with that of the S&P 500 Index.

First, let's calculate the percentage change in the S&P 500 Healthcare Equipment & Supply Index and the S&P 500 Index from 2010 to 2015.

For the S&P 500 Healthcare Equipment & Supply Index:
The starting value in 2010 is 100, and the ending value in 2015 is 199.

percentage_change_healthcare = ((199 - 100) / 100) * 100
percentage_change_healthcare = 99%

For the S&P 500 Index:
The starting value in 2010 is 100, and the ending value in 2015 is 181.

percentage_change_market = ((181 - 100) / 100) * 100
percentage_change_market = 81%

Now, let's calculate the percentage by which the healthcare sector outperformed the overall market.

percentage_outperformance = percentage_change_healthcare - percentage_change_market
percentage_outperformance = 99% - 81%
percentage_outperformance = 18%

Therefore, the healthcare sector outperformed the overall market by 18% in this 5-year period.

30,"what is the percent of the owned and operated of the rail network route miles","81.77%","<REASONING>
To find the percentage of the owned and operated rail network route miles, we need to divide the owned and operated miles by the total route miles and multiply by 100.

From the context, we have the following values:
- Total route miles = 31838
- Owned miles = 26009
- Operated miles (pursuant to trackage rights or leases) = 31838 - 26009 = 5829

Now, we can calculate the percentage of owned and operated miles:

Percentage of owned miles = (26009 / 31838) * 100
Percentage of operated miles = (5829 / 31838) * 100

Percentage of owned miles = 0.8177 * 100
Percentage of operated miles = 0.1833 * 100

Percentage of owned miles = 81.77%
Percentage of operated miles = 18.23%

Therefore, the percentage of the owned and operated rail network route miles is 81.77% for owned miles and 18.23% for operated miles.

the china national tobacco corporation , the chinese state-owned tobacco entity , controls the remaining ownership interest in each of these ventures .
our chinese acetate ventures fund their operations using operating cash flow and pay a dividend in the second quarter of each fiscal year based on the ventures' performance for the preceding year .
in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , we received cash dividends of $ 83 million , $ 78 million and $ 71 million , respectively .

raw materials and energy we purchase a variety of raw materials and energy from sources in many countries for use in our production processes .
we have a policy of maintaining , when available , multiple sources of supply for materials .
however , some of our individual plants may have single sources of supply for some of their raw materials , such as carbon monoxide , steam and acetaldehyde .
although we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials , there can be no assurance that unforeseen developments will not affect our raw material supply .
even if we have multiple sources of supply for a raw material , there can be no assurance that these sources can make up for the loss of a major supplier .
it is also possible profitability will be adversely affected if we are required to qualify additional sources of supply to our specifications in the event of the loss of a sole supplier .
in addition , the price of raw materials varies , often substantially , from year to year. .

                To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = (58620 / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = 0.2931 * 100

                percentage_change = 29.31%

To find the investment advisory revenues in 2007, we need to look for the relevant information in the provided context. The context contains a detailed description of the company's financial performance for the years 2007, 2008, and 2009. We can find the investment advisory revenues for 2007 in the section that compares the company's performance between 2008 and 2007.

According to the context, investment advisory revenues decreased 6.3% (6.3%) or $118 million, to $1.76 billion in 2008 as average assets under our management decreased $16 billion to $358.2 billion. This implies that the investment advisory revenues in 2008 were $1.76 billion. To find the investment advisory revenues in 2007, we can add the decrease of $118 million to the investment advisory revenues in 2008.

Therefore, the investment advisory revenues in 2007 were $1.76 billion + $118 million = $1.878 billion.

34,"what percentage of specialty businesses sales where due to chemicals sales in 2004?","60%","<REASONING>
To find the percentage of specialty businesses sales that were due to chemicals sales in 2004, we need to first find the sales from chemicals in 2004 and then divide it by the total sales of specialty businesses in 2004.

From the context, we can see that the sales from chemicals in 2004 were $672 million.

The total sales of specialty businesses in 2004 were $1120 million.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of specialty businesses sales that were due to chemicals sales in 2004:

percentage = (sales from chemicals in 2004 / total sales of specialty businesses in 2004) * 100

percentage = ($672 million / $1120 million) * 100

percentage = 0.6 * 100

percentage = 60%

Therefore, the percentage of specialty businesses sales that were due to chemicals sales in 2004 is 60%.

                Substituting the given values:

                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

chemicals sales were $ 692 million in 2005 , com- pared with $ 672 million in 2004 and $ 625 million in 2003 .
although demand was strong for most arizona chemical product lines , operating profits in 2005 were 84% ( 84 % ) and 83% ( 83 % ) lower than in 2004 and 2003 , re- spectively , due to higher energy costs in the u.s. , and higher prices and reduced availability for crude tall oil ( cto ) .
in the united states , energy costs increased 41% ( 41 % ) compared to 2004 due to higher natural gas prices and supply interruption costs .
cto prices increased 26% ( 26 % ) compared to 2004 , as certain energy users turned to cto as a substitute fuel for high-cost alternative energy sources such as natural gas and fuel oil .
european cto receipts decreased 30% ( 30 % ) compared to 2004 due to lower yields following the finnish paper industry strike and a swedish storm that limited cto throughput and corre- sponding sales volumes .
other businesses in this operating segment include operations that have been sold , closed , or are held for sale , principally the european distribution business , the oil and gas and mineral royalty business , decorative products , retail packaging , and the natchez chemical cellulose pulp mill .
sales for these businesses were ap- proximately $ 223 million in 2005 ( mainly european distribution and decorative products ) compared with $ 448 million in 2004 ( mainly european distribution and decorative products ) , and $ 610 million in 2003 .
liquidity and capital resources overview a major factor in international paper 2019s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operat- ing cash flow , which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products .
while changes in key cash operating costs , such as energy and raw material costs , do have an effect on operating cash generation , we believe that our strong focus on cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle .
as a result , we believe that we are well positioned for improvements in operating cash flow should prices and worldwide economic conditions im- prove in the future .
as part of our continuing focus on improving our return on investment , we have focused our capital spending on improving our key platform businesses in north america and in geographic areas with strong growth opportunities .
spending levels have been kept below the level of depreciation and amortization charges for each of the last three years , and we anticipate con- tinuing this approach in 2006 .
with the low interest rate environment in 2005 , financing activities have focused largely on the repay- ment or refinancing of higher coupon debt , resulting in a net reduction in debt of approximately $ 1.7 billion in 2005 .
we plan to continue this program , with addi- tional reductions anticipated as our previously an- nounced transformation plan progresses in 2006 .
our liquidity position continues to be strong , with approx- imately $ 3.2 billion of committed liquidity to cover fu- ture short-term cash flow requirements not met by operating cash flows. .

To find the percentage of specialty businesses sales that were due to chemicals sales in 2005, we need to divide the chemicals sales by the total specialty businesses sales and multiply by 100.

From the context, we can see that the total specialty businesses sales in 2005 were $915 million and the chemicals sales were $692 million.

percentage_of_chemicals_sales = (chemicals_sales / total_specialty_businesses_sales) * 100

Substituting the given values:

percentage_of_chemicals_sales = ($692 million / $915 million) * 100

percentage_of_chemicals_sales = 0.757 * 100

percentage_of_chemicals_sales = 75.7%

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

lumber and plywood operating costs also reflected substantially higher glue and natural gas costs versus both 2004 and looking forward to the first quarter of 2006 , a con- tinued strong housing market , combined with low prod- uct inventory in the distribution chain , should translate into continued strong lumber and plywood demand .

chemicals sales were $ 692 million in 2005 , com- pared with $ 672 million in 2004 and $ 625 million in 2003 .
although demand was strong for most arizona chemical product lines , operating profits in 2005 were 84% ( 84 % ) and 83% ( 83 % ) lower than in 2004 and 2003 , re- spectively , due to higher energy costs in the u.s. , and higher prices and reduced availability for crude tall oil ( cto ) .
in the united states , energy costs increased 41% ( 41 % ) compared to 2004 due to higher natural gas prices and supply interruption costs .
cto prices increased 26% ( 26 % ) compared to 2004 , as certain energy users turned to cto as a substitute fuel for high-cost alternative energy sources such as natural gas and fuel oil .
european cto receipts decreased 30% ( 30 % ) compared to 2004 due to lower yields following the finnish paper industry strike and a swedish storm that limited cto throughput and corre- sponding sales volumes .
other businesses in this operating segment include operations that have been sold , closed , or are held for sale , principally the european distribution business , the oil and gas and mineral royalty business , decorative products , retail packaging , and the natchez chemical cellulose pulp mill .
sales for these businesses were ap- proximately $ 223 million in 2005 ( mainly european distribution and decorative products ) compared with $ 448 million in 2004 ( mainly european distribution and decorative products ) , and $ 610 million in 2003 .
liquidity and capital resources overview a major factor in international paper 2019s liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operat- ing cash flow , which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products .
while changes in key cash operating costs , such as energy and raw material costs , do have an effect on operating cash generation , we believe that our strong focus on cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle .
as a result , we believe that we are well positioned for improvements in operating cash flow should prices and worldwide economic conditions im- prove in the future .
as part of our continuing focus on improving our return on investment , we have focused our capital spending on improving our key platform businesses in north america and in geographic areas with strong growth opportunities .
spending levels have been kept below the level of depreciation and amortization charges for each of the last three years , and we anticipate con- tinuing this approach in 2006 .
with the low interest rate environment in 2005 , financing activities have focused largely on the repay- ment or refinancing of higher coupon debt , resulting in a net reduction in debt of approximately $ 1.7 billion in 2005 .
we plan to continue this program , with addi- tional reductions anticipated as our previously an- nounced transformation plan progresses in 2006 .
our liquidity position continues to be strong , with approx- imately $ 3.2 billion of committed liquidity to cover fu- ture short-term cash flow requirements not met by operating cash flows. .

36,"how much money can be deducted from income taxes from the 2014 to 2016 , not counting goodwill and intangible assets?","$20.4 million","<REASONING>
To calculate the amount of money that can be deducted from income taxes from 2014 to 2016, not counting goodwill and intangible assets, we need to find the depreciation expense for property, plant, and equipment for the given years. 

From the provided context, we can see that the depreciation expense for property, plant, and equipment was $114.1 million in 2014, $130.1 million in 2015, and $134.5 million in 2016.

Since the context does not provide information on the tax rate or any other relevant details, we cannot calculate the exact amount of money that can be deducted from income taxes. However, we can conclude that the depreciation expense for property, plant, and equipment increased from 2014 to 2016.

Therefore, the amount of money that can be deducted from income taxes from 2014 to 2016, not counting goodwill and intangible assets, is the difference in depreciation expense between 2016 and 2014.

The difference in depreciation expense is $134.5 million (2016) - $114.1 million (2014) = $20.4 million.

However, without the tax rate, we cannot calculate the exact amount of money that can be deducted from income taxes.

notes to consolidated financial statements 2014 ( continued ) depreciation expense for property , plant and equipment was $ 134.5 million , $ 130.1 million and $ 114.1 million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively .
the company reviews property , plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable .
recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives .
if such assets are considered to be impaired , the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price , if any , or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique .
if such assets are not impaired , but their useful lives have decreased , the remaining net book value is depreciated over the revised useful life .
we have not recorded any material impairment charges related to our property , plant and equipment in fiscal 2016 , fiscal 2015 or fiscal 2014 .
f .
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill the company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually , as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable .
the company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level ( operating segment or one level below an operating segment ) on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter ( on or about august 1 ) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist .
for the company 2019s latest annual impairment assessment that occurred as of july 31 , 2016 , the company identified its reporting units to be its seven operating segments .
the performance of the test involves a two-step process .
the first step of the quantitative impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values , including goodwill .
the company determines the fair value of its reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches .
under the income approach , the company uses a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues , gross profit margins , operating income margins , working capital cash flow , perpetual growth rates , and long-term discount rates , among others .
for the market approach , the company uses the guideline public company method .
under this method the company utilizes information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units , to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested , in order to obtain their respective fair values .
in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values , the company reconciles the aggregate fair values of its reporting units determined , as described above , to its current market capitalization , allowing for a reasonable control premium .
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit , calculated using the above approaches , exceeds the reporting unit 2019s fair value , the company performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss .
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit 2019s goodwill with the carrying value of that reporting unit .
there was no impairment of goodwill in any of the fiscal years presented .
the company 2019s next annual impairment assessment will be performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending october 28 , 2017 ( fiscal 2017 ) unless indicators arise that would require the company to reevaluate at an earlier date .

for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans , we have adopted accounting guidance that defines fair value , establishes a framework for measuring fair value and prescribes disclosures about fair value measurements .
accounting guidance defines fair value as ""the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date."" following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value .
there have been no changes in the methodologies used at december 31 , 2018 compared to december 31 , 2017 .
common and preferred stocks and short-term and other investments : valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded or based on the active market for similar securities .
certain investments are valued based on net asset value ( ""nav"" ) , which approximates fair value .
such basis is determined by referencing the respective fund's underlying assets .
there are no unfunded commitments or other restrictions associated with these investments .
private equity and hedge funds : valued based on an estimated fair value using either a market approach or an income approach , both of which require a significant degree of judgment .
there is no active trading market for these investments and they are generally illiquid .
due to the significant unobservable inputs , the fair value measurements used to estimate fair value are a level 3 input .
certain investments are valued based on nav , which approximates fair value .
such basis is determined by referencing the respective fund's underlying assets .
there are no unfunded commitments or other restrictions associated with the investments valued at nav .
corporate , government and other debt securities : valued based on either the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded or using pricing models maximizing the use of observable inputs for similar securities .
this includes basing value on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings .
certain investments are valued based on nav , which approximates fair value .
such basis is determined by referencing the respective fund's underlying assets .
there are unfunded commitments of $ 1 million and no other restrictions associated with these investments .
common collective trust fund : valued based on an amortized cost basis , which approximates fair value .
such basis is determined by reference to the respective fund's underlying assets , which are primarily cash equivalents .
there are no unfunded commitments or other restrictions associated with this fund .
buy-in annuity : valued based on the associated benefit obligation for which the buy-in annuity covers the benefits , which approximates fair value .
such basis is determined based on various assumptions , including the discount rate , long-term rate of return on plan assets and mortality rate .
the methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values .
furthermore , while we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants , the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date .
the following tables set forth , by level within the fair value hierarchy , the qualified defined-benefit pension plan assets at fair value as of december 31 , 2018 and 2017 , as well as those valued at nav using the practical expedient , which approximates fair value , in millions. .

38,"what was the percent of the increase in the debt securities","75%","<REASONING>
To calculate the percentage increase in the debt securities, we can use the formula:

percentage_increase = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values from the table:

old_value = 28% (2017)
new_value = 49% (2018)

percentage_increase = ((49 - 28) / 28) * 100

percentage_increase = (21 / 28) * 100

percentage_increase = 0.75 * 100

percentage_increase = 75%

Therefore, the percentage increase in the debt securities from 2017 to 2018 is 75%.

for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans , we have adopted accounting guidance that defines fair value , establishes a framework for measuring fair value and prescribes disclosures about fair value measurements .
accounting guidance defines fair value as ""the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date."" following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value .
there have been no changes in the methodologies used at december 31 , 2018 compared to december 31 , 2017 .
common and preferred stocks and short-term and other investments : valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded or based on the active market for similar securities .
certain investments are valued based on net asset value ( ""nav"" ) , which approximates fair value .
such basis is determined by referencing the respective fund's underlying assets .
there are no unfunded commitments or other restrictions associated with these investments .
private equity and hedge funds : valued based on an estimated fair value using either a market approach or an income approach , both of which require a significant degree of judgment .
there is no active trading market for these investments and they are generally illiquid .
due to the significant unobservable inputs , the fair value measurements used to estimate fair value are a level 3 input .
certain investments are valued based on nav , which approximates fair value .
such basis is determined by referencing the respective fund's underlying assets .
there are no unfunded commitments or other restrictions associated with the investments valued at nav .
corporate , government and other debt securities : valued based on either the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded or using pricing models maximizing the use of observable inputs for similar securities .
this includes basing value on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings .
certain investments are valued based on nav , which approximates fair value .
such basis is determined by referencing the respective fund's underlying assets .
there are unfunded commitments of $ 1 million and no other restrictions associated with these investments .
common collective trust fund : valued based on an amortized cost basis , which approximates fair value .
such basis is determined by reference to the respective fund's underlying assets , which are primarily cash equivalents .
there are no unfunded commitments or other restrictions associated with this fund .
buy-in annuity : valued based on the associated benefit obligation for which the buy-in annuity covers the benefits , which approximates fair value .
such basis is determined based on various assumptions , including the discount rate , long-term rate of return on plan assets and mortality rate .
the methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values .

39,"for the period of october 1 2013 31 , what percent of share purchases were not shares purchased as part of publicly announced programs?","0.2437%","<REASONING>
To calculate the percentage of share purchases that were not shares purchased as part of publicly announced programs for the period of October 1, 2013 - 31, we need to first determine the total number of shares purchased and the number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced programs during this period.

From the provided table, we can see that the total number of shares purchased during this period is 1204 + 1491 + 3458 = 6153.

The number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced programs during this period is 1189 + 1491 + 3458 = 6138.

To find the number of shares purchased that were not part of publicly announced programs, we subtract the number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced programs from the total number of shares purchased: 6153 - 6138 = 15.

To calculate the percentage, we divide the number of shares purchased that were not part of publicly announced programs by the total number of shares purchased and multiply by 100: (15 / 6153) * 100 = 0.2437%.

Therefore, the percentage of share purchases that were not shares purchased as part of publicly announced programs for the period of October 1, 2013 - 31 is 0.2437%.

To calculate the decrease in operating revenue from 2013 to 2014, we can use the given data from the table summarizing the operating results of discontinued operations.

The operating revenue in 2013 was $23 and in 2014 was $13.

To find the decrease, we subtract the 2014 operating revenue from the 2013 operating revenue:

decrease = 2013 operating revenue - 2014 operating revenue
decrease = $23 - $13
decrease = $10

Therefore, the operating revenue decreased by $10 from 2013 to 2014.

                To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

                percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = (58620 / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = 0.2931 * 100

                percentage_change = 29.31%

41,"what is the growth rate in net revenue in 2003 for entergy arkansas , inc.?","-8.85%","<REASONING>
To calculate the growth rate in net revenue in 2003 for Entergy Arkansas, Inc., we can use the formula:

growth_rate = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values from the table:

old_value = 1095.9 (2002 net revenue)
new_value = 998.7 (2003 net revenue)

growth_rate = ((998.7 - 1095.9) / 1095.9) * 100

growth_rate = (-97.2 / 1095.9) * 100

growth_rate = -0.0885 * 100

growth_rate = -8.85%

Therefore, the growth rate in net revenue in 2003 for Entergy Arkansas, Inc. is -8.85%.

the march 2002 settlement agreement resolved a request for recovery of ice storm costs incurred in december 2000 with an offset of those costs for funds contributed to pay for future stranded costs .
a 1997 settlement provided for the collection of earnings in excess of an 11% ( 11 % ) return on equity in a transition cost account ( tca ) to offset stranded costs if retail open access were implemented .
in mid- and late december 2000 , two separate ice storms left 226000 and 212500 entergy arkansas customers , respectively , without electric power in its service area .
entergy arkansas filed a proposal to recover costs plus carrying charges associated with power restoration caused by the ice storms .
entergy arkansas' final storm damage cost determination reflected costs of approximately $ 195 million .
the apsc approved a settlement agreement submitted in march 2002 by entergy arkansas , the apsc staff , and the arkansas attorney general .
in the march 2002 settlement , the parties agreed that $ 153 million of the ice storm costs would be classified as incremental ice storm expenses that can be offset against the tca on a rate class basis , and any excess of ice storm costs over the amount available in the tca would be deferred and amortized over 30 years , although such excess costs were not allowed to be included as a separate component of rate base .
the allocated ice storm expenses exceeded the available tca funds by $ 15.8 million which was recorded as a regulatory asset in june 2002 .
in accordance with the settlement agreement and following the apsc's approval of the 2001 earnings review related to the tca , entergy arkansas filed to return $ 18.1 million of the tca to certain large general service class customers that paid more into the tca than their allocation of storm costs .
the apsc approved the return of funds to the large general service customer class in the form of refund checks in august 2002 .
as part of the implementation of the march 2002 settlement agreement provisions , the tca procedure ceased with the 2001 earnings evaluation .
of the remaining ice storm costs , $ 32.2 million was addressed through established ratemaking procedures , including $ 22.2 million classified as capital additions , while $ 3.8 million of the ice storm costs was not recovered through rates .
the effect on net income of the march 2002 settlement agreement and 2001 earnings review was a $ 2.2 million increase in 2003 , because the decrease in net revenue was offset by the decrease in operation and maintenance expenses discussed below. .

To calculate by how much Apple Inc. outperformed the S&P Computer Hardware Index over the 6-year period, we need to find the difference in the cumulative total shareholder return of Apple Inc. and the S&P Computer Hardware Index, and then divide it by the cumulative total shareholder return of the S&P Computer Hardware Index.

From the given table, we can see that the cumulative total shareholder return of Apple Inc. at the end of the 6-year period (September 30, 2013) is $431, and the cumulative total shareholder return of the S&P Computer Hardware Index at the end of the 6-year period is $197.

First, let's find the cumulative total shareholder return of Apple Inc. and the S&P Computer Hardware Index at the beginning of the 6-year period (September 30, 2008). Both are $100.

Now, let's calculate the cumulative total shareholder return for both Apple Inc. and the S&P Computer Hardware Index for each year from 2009 to 2013, and then find the difference between the two cumulative total shareholder returns for each year.

For 2009: Apple Inc. = $163, S&P Computer Hardware Index = $118. Difference = $45.

For 2010: Apple Inc. = $250, S&P Computer Hardware Index = $140. Difference = $110.

For 2011: Apple Inc. = $335, S&P Computer Hardware Index = $159. Difference = $176.

For 2012: Apple Inc. = $589, S&P Computer Hardware Index = $255. Difference = $334.

            <QUESTION>What is the percentage change in the net cash from operating activities from 2008 to 2009?</QUESTION>
            <CONTEXT>
            In 2008, the net cash from operating activities was $200,000.
            In 2009, the net cash from operating activities was $258,620.

        </INPUT>
        <OUTPUT>
            <REASONING>
                To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

                percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = (58620 / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = 0.2931 * 100

                percentage_change = 29.31%

                Therefore, the percentage change in the net cash from operating activities from 2008 to 2009 is 29.31%.

43,"what was the percentage difference of earnings per share 2013 basic pro forma compared to earnings per share 2013 diluted pro forma in 2005?","-1.067%","<REASONING>
To find the percentage difference of earnings per share (EPS) 2013 basic pro forma compared to EPS 2013 diluted pro forma in 2005, we first need to identify the relevant values from the provided context.

From the table, we can see that the EPS 2013 basic pro forma in 2005 was $3.75 and the EPS 2013 diluted pro forma in 2005 was $3.71.

To calculate the percentage difference, we can use the formula:

percentage_difference = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 3.75 (EPS 2013 basic pro forma)
new_value = 3.71 (EPS 2013 diluted pro forma)

percentage_difference = ((3.71 - 3.75) / 3.75) * 100

percentage_difference = (-0.04 / 3.75) * 100

percentage_difference = -0.01067 * 100

percentage_difference = -1.067%

Therefore, the percentage difference of EPS 2013 basic pro forma compared to EPS 2013 diluted pro forma in 2005 is -1.067%.

                To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

                percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = (58620 / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = 0.2931 * 100

                percentage_change = 29.31%

stock-based compensation 2013 we have several stock-based compensation plans under which employees and non-employee directors receive stock options , nonvested retention shares , and nonvested stock units .
we refer to the nonvested shares and stock units collectively as 201cretention awards 201d .
we issue treasury shares to cover option exercises and stock unit vestings , while new shares are issued when retention shares vest .
we adopted fasb statement no .
123 ( r ) , share-based payment ( fas 123 ( r ) ) , on january 1 , 2006 .
fas 123 ( r ) requires us to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors , including stock options .
compensation expense is based on the calculated fair value of the awards as measured at the grant date and is expensed ratably over the service period of the awards ( generally the vesting period ) .
the fair value of retention awards is the stock price on the date of grant , while the fair value of stock options is determined by using the black-scholes option pricing model .
we elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by fas 123 ( r ) and did not restate financial results for prior periods .
we did not make an adjustment for the cumulative effect of these estimated forfeitures , as the impact was not material .
as a result of the adoption of fas 123 ( r ) , we recognized expense for stock options in 2006 , in addition to retention awards , which were expensed prior to 2006 .
stock-based compensation expense for the year ended december 31 , 2006 was $ 22 million , after tax , or $ 0.08 per basic and diluted share .
this includes $ 9 million for stock options and $ 13 million for retention awards for 2006 .
before taxes , stock-based compensation expense included $ 14 million for stock options and $ 21 million for retention awards for 2006 .
we recorded $ 29 million of excess tax benefits as an inflow of financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 , 2006 .
prior to the adoption of fas 123 ( r ) , we applied the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no .
25 , accounting for stock issued to employees , and related interpretations .
no stock- based employee compensation expense related to stock option grants was reflected in net income , as all options granted under those plans had a grant price equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant .
stock-based compensation expense related to retention shares , stock units , and other incentive plans was reflected in net income .
the following table details the effect on net income and earnings per share had compensation expense for all of our stock-based awards , including stock options , been recorded in the years ended december 31 , 2005 and 2004 based on the fair value method under fasb statement no .

44,"what percentage has renting lease expenses increased from 2017 to 2019?","56.94%","<REASONING>
To calculate the percentage increase in lease expenses from 2017 to 2019, we can use the formula:

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 58,800,000 (lease expense in 2017)
new_value = 92,300,000 (lease expense in 2019)

percentage_change = ((92,300,000 - 58,800,000) / 58,800,000) * 100

percentage_change = (33,500,000 / 58,800,000) * 100

percentage_change = 0.5694 * 100

percentage_change = 56.94%

Therefore, the percentage increase in lease expenses from 2017 to 2019 is 56.94%.

To calculate the percentage of the carrying amount of proved oil and gas properties concerning the total carrying amount in 2017, we need to find the carrying amount of proved oil and gas properties and the total carrying amount in 2017.

| carrying amount at end of period | $954,377 | $94,684,800 |

The total carrying amount in 2017 is $94,684,800.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the carrying amount of proved oil and gas properties concerning the total carrying amount in 2017:

percentage = (carrying amount of proved oil and gas properties / total carrying amount) * 100
percentage = ($370,000,000 / $94,684,800) * 100
percentage = 0.3907 * 100
percentage = 39.07%

accounting for certain long-lived assets eog reviews its proved oil and gas properties for impairment purposes by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation , depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset .
the carrying values for assets determined to be impaired were adjusted to estimated fair value using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the asc .
in certain instances , eog utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value .
during 2018 , proved oil and gas properties with a carrying amount of $ 139 million were written down to their fair value of $ 18 million , resulting in pretax impairment charges of $ 121 million .
during 2017 , proved oil and gas properties with a carrying amount of $ 370 million were written down to their fair value of $ 146 million , resulting in pretax impairment charges of $ 224 million .
impairments in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 included domestic legacy natural gas assets .
amortization and impairments of unproved oil and gas property costs , including amortization of capitalized interest , were $ 173 million , $ 211 million and $ 291 million during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively .

46,"what is the percentage decrease in average price per share from october to november?","8.91%","<REASONING>
To calculate the percentage decrease in average price per share from October to November, we need to first find the average price per share for each month and then calculate the percentage decrease.

The average price per share for October is $20.74 and for November is $18.89.

To find the percentage decrease, we can use the formula:

percentage_decrease = ((old_value - new_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = $20.74
new_value = $18.89

percentage_decrease = (($20.74 - $18.89) / $20.74) * 100

percentage_decrease = ($1.85 / $20.74) * 100

percentage_decrease = 0.0891 * 100

percentage_decrease = 8.91%

Therefore, the percentage decrease in average price per share from October to November is 8.91%.

</table>

gross margin percentage of 34.0% ( 34.0 % ) in 2007 increased significantly from 29.0% ( 29.0 % ) in 2006 .
the primary drivers of this increase were more favorable costs on certain commodity components , including nand flash memory and dram memory , higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs and a higher percentage of revenue from the company 2019s direct sales channels .
the company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margins of the personal computer , consumer electronics and mobile communication industries will be subject to pressure due to price competition .
the company expects gross margin percentage to decline sequentially in the first quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of the full-quarter impact of product transitions and reduced pricing that were effected in the fourth quarter of 2007 , lower sales of ilife and iwork in their second quarter of availability , seasonally higher component costs , and a higher mix of indirect sales .
these factors are expected to be partially offset by higher sales of the company 2019s mac os x operating system due to the introduction of mac os x version 10.5 leopard ( 2018 2018mac os x leopard 2019 2019 ) that became available in october 2007 .
the foregoing statements regarding the company 2019s expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking .
there can be no assurance that current gross margin percentage will be maintained or targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved .
in general , gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors , including continued industry wide global pricing pressures , increased competition , compressed product life cycles , potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services , and a potential shift in the company 2019s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins .
in response to these competitive pressures , the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products .
gross margins could also be affected by the company 2019s ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to stimulate .

48,"what is the percent change in average u.s . short-duration advances between 2012 and 2013?","19.47%","<REASONING>
To calculate the percentage change in average U.S. short-duration advances between 2012 and 2013, we can use the formula:

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 1972
new_value = 2356

percentage_change = ((2356 - 1972) / 1972) * 100

percentage_change = (384 / 1972) * 100

percentage_change = 0.1947 * 100

percentage_change = 19.47%

Therefore, the percentage change in average U.S. short-duration advances between 2012 and 2013 is 19.47%.

short-duration advances provide liquidity to clients in support of their investment activities .
although average short-duration advances for the year ended december 31 , 2014 increased compared to the year ended december 31 , 2013 , such average advances remained low relative to historical levels , mainly the result of clients continuing to hold higher levels of liquidity .
average other interest-earning assets increased to $ 15.94 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2014 from $ 11.16 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2013 .
the increased levels were primarily the result of higher levels of cash collateral provided in connection with our enhanced custody business .
aggregate average interest-bearing deposits increased to $ 130.30 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2014 from $ 109.25 billion for year ended 2013 .
the higher levels were primarily the result of increases in both u.s .
and non-u.s .
transaction accounts and time deposits .
future transaction account levels will be influenced by the underlying asset servicing business , as well as market conditions , including the general levels of u.s .
and non-u.s .
interest rates .
average other short-term borrowings increased to $ 4.18 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2014 from $ 3.79 billion for the year ended 2013 .
the increase was the result of a higher level of client demand for our commercial paper .
the decline in rates paid from 1.6% ( 1.6 % ) in 2013 to 0.1% ( 0.1 % ) in 2014 resulted from a reclassification of certain derivative contracts that hedge our interest-rate risk on certain assets and liabilities , which reduced interest revenue and interest expense .
average long-term debt increased to $ 9.31 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2014 from $ 8.42 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2013 .
the increase primarily reflected the issuance of $ 1.5 billion of senior and subordinated debt in may 2013 , $ 1.0 billion of senior debt issued in november 2013 , and $ 1.0 billion of senior debt issued in december 2014 .
this is partially offset by the maturities of $ 500 million of senior debt in may 2014 and $ 250 million of senior debt in march 2014 .
average other interest-bearing liabilities increased to $ 7.35 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2014 from $ 6.46 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2013 , primarily the result of higher levels of cash collateral received from clients in connection with our enhanced custody business .
several factors could affect future levels of our net interest revenue and margin , including the mix of client liabilities ; actions of various central banks ; changes in u.s .
and non-u.s .
interest rates ; changes in the various yield curves around the world ; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards , or interpretations of those standards ; the amount of discount accretion generated by the former conduit securities that remain in our investment securities portfolio ; and the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured .
based on market conditions and other factors , we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated securities , such as u.s .
treasury and agency securities , municipal securities , federal agency mortgage-backed securities and u.s .
and non-u.s .
mortgage- and asset-backed securities .
the pace at which we continue to reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions and other factors over time .
we expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to influence what effect our reinvestment program will have on future levels of our net interest revenue and net interest margin. .

49,"what was the total cost of share repurchases , in millions , during 2018?","$1,912.134249 million","<REASONING>
To calculate the total cost of share repurchases in millions during 2018, we need to multiply the total number of shares purchased by the average price paid per share for each month and then sum them up. We also need to consider the additional shares purchased by employees to pay stock option exercise prices, satisfy excess tax withholding obligations, and pay withholding obligations for vesting of retention shares.

From the provided context, we have the following data:

- October 1 through October 31: 6,091,605 shares purchased at an average price of $158.20
- November 1 through November 30: 3,408,467 shares purchased at an average price of $147.91
- December 1 through December 31: 3,007,951 shares purchased at an average price of $148.40

Additionally, we have the following information about the total number of shares purchased during the quarter, which includes approximately 17,391 shares delivered or attested to by employees:

- Total shares purchased during the quarter: 12,508,023

We also have the following information about the publicly announced plan or program:

- Maximum number of shares remaining under the plan or program: 26,428,119

Now, let's calculate the total cost of share repurchases in millions during 2018:

1. Calculate the cost for October: 6,091,605 shares * $158.20 = $963,111,230
2. Calculate the cost for November: 3,408,467 shares * $147.91 = $503,511,111
3. Calculate the cost for December: 3,007,951 shares * $148.40 = $446,511,908

Now, let's sum up the costs for each month:

$963,111,230 + $503,511,111 + $446,511,908 = $1,912,134,249

To convert this to millions, we divide by 1,000,000:

$1,912,134,249 / 1,000,000 = $1,912.134249

Therefore, the total cost of share repurchases in millions during 2018 is $1,912.134249 million, or approximately $1.912 billion.

To calculate the percentage increase in net cash from investing activities between 2011 and 2012, we can use the formula:

percentage_increase = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = -594 (net cash used in investing activities in 2011)
new_value = -533 (net cash used in investing activities in 2012)

percentage_increase = ((-533 - (-594)) / (-594)) * 100

percentage_increase = ((61) / (-594)) * 100

percentage_increase = -0.1026 * 100

percentage_increase = -10.26%

            In 2008, the net cash from operating activities was $200,000.

                To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

                percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = (58620 / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = 0.2931 * 100

                percentage_change = 29.31%

                Therefore, the percentage change in the net cash from operating activities from 2008 to 2009 is 29.31%.

we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions .
we use this non-gaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment , dividend distributions , acquisition opportunities , and share repurchases .
our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure , as follows: .

year-over-year change 22.4 % (  % ) 87.5 % (  % ) year-over-year changes in cash flow ( as defined ) were driven by improved performance in working capital resulting from the benefit derived from the pringles acquisition , as well as changes in the level of capital expenditures during the three-year period .
investing activities our net cash used in investing activities for 2012 amounted to $ 3245 million , an increase of $ 2658 million compared with 2011 primarily attributable to the $ 2668 acquisition of pringles in capital spending in 2012 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure , and to support capacity requirements in certain markets , including pringles .
in addition , we continued the investment in our information technology infrastructure related to the reimplementation and upgrade of our sap platform .
net cash used in investing activities of $ 587 million in 2011 increased by $ 122 million compared with 2010 , reflecting capital projects for our reimplementation and upgrade of our sap platform and investments in our supply chain .
cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales has decreased to 3.8% ( 3.8 % ) in 2012 , from 4.5% ( 4.5 % ) in 2011 , which was an increase from 3.8% ( 3.8 % ) in financing activities in february 2013 , we issued $ 250 million of two-year floating-rate u.s .
dollar notes , and $ 400 million of ten-year 2.75% ( 2.75 % ) u.s .
dollar notes .
the proceeds from these notes will be used for general corporate purposes , including , together with cash on hand , repayment of the $ 750 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% ( 4.25 % ) u.s .
dollar notes due march 2013 .
the floating-rate notes bear interest equal to three-month libor plus 23 basis points , subject to quarterly reset .
the notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of kellogg company and its restricted subsidiaries ( as defined ) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions , as well as a change of control provision .
our net cash provided by financing activities was $ 1317 for 2012 , compared to net cash used in financing activities of $ 957 and $ 439 for 2011 and 2010 , respectively .
the increase in cash provided from financing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010 , was primarily due to the issuance of debt related to the acquisition of pringles .
total debt was $ 7.9 billion at year-end 2012 and $ 6.0 billion at year-end 2011 .

in april 2010 , our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to $ 2.5 billion during 2010 through 2012 .
this three year authorization replaced previous share buyback programs which had authorized stock repurchases of up to $ 1.1 billion for 2010 and $ 650 million for 2009 .
under this program , we repurchased approximately 1 million , 15 million and 21 million shares of common stock for $ 63 million , $ 793 million and $ 1.1 billion during 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively .
in december 2012 , our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to $ 300 million during 2013 .
we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling $ 1.74 per share in 2012 , $ 1.67 per share in 2011 and $ 1.56 per share in 2010 .
total cash paid for dividends increased by 3.0% ( 3.0 % ) in 2012 and 3.4% ( 3.4 % ) in 2011 .
in march 2011 , we entered into an unsecured four- year credit agreement which allows us to borrow , on a revolving credit basis , up to $ 2.0 billion .
our long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit kellogg company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease-back transactions .
some agreements also contain change in control provisions .
however , they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings .
a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the u.s .
short-term debt market and/or increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future .
however , even under these circumstances , we would continue to have access to our four-year credit agreement , which expires in march 2015 .
this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis , although we do not currently plan to use it .
capital and credit markets , including commercial paper markets , continued to experience instability and disruption as the u.s .
and global economies underwent a period of extreme uncertainty .
throughout this period of uncertainty , we continued to have access to the u.s. , european , and canadian commercial paper markets .
our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings were not affected by the changes in the credit environment .
we monitor the financial strength of our third-party financial institutions , including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities , our derivative financial instruments , and other arrangements .
we are in compliance with all covenants as of december 29 , 2012 .
we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future , while still meeting our operational needs , including the pursuit of selected bolt-on acquisitions .
this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow , our short- term borrowings , and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis. .

51,"what is the roi of an investment in s&p500 from 2006 to 2007?","82.87%","<REASONING>
To calculate the return on investment (ROI) of an investment in the S&P 500 from 2006 to 2007, we need to first determine the total return of the S&P 500 for the given period. The total return is calculated as the sum of the capital appreciation and the dividend yield.

From the provided context, we can see that the values for the S&P 500 index for the given period are as follows:

- December 28, 2002: 100.00
- January 3, 2004: 128.68
- January 1, 2005: 142.69
- December 31, 2005: 149.70
- December 30, 2006: 173.34
- December 29, 2007: 182.87

To calculate the total return, we can use the formula:

total_return = (end_value / start_value) - 1

Substituting the given values:

start_value = 100.00 (December 28, 2002)
end_value = 182.87 (December 29, 2007)

total_return = (182.87 / 100.00) - 1
total_return = 1.8287 - 1
total_return = 0.8287

Therefore, the total return of the S&P 500 from 2006 to 2007 is 82.87%.

To calculate the ROI, we need to know the initial investment amount. However, the context does not provide this information. Therefore, we cannot calculate the ROI without this information.

However, we can calculate the ROI if we assume an initial investment amount of $100. In this case, the ROI would be:

ROI = (total_return * 100) / initial_investment
ROI = (0.8287 * 100) / 100
ROI = 82.87%

Therefore, the ROI of an investment in the S&P 500 from 2006 to 2007, assuming an initial investment of $100, is 82.87%.

52,"what is the roi of an investment in cadence design system from 2006 to 2007?","-5.03%","<REASONING>
To calculate the return on investment (ROI) of an investment in Cadence Design Systems from 2006 to 2007, we need to find the return on investment for the given period. The return on investment can be calculated using the formula:

ROI = (Gain from investment / Cost of investment) * 100

However, the provided context does not give us the cost of investment. Instead, it provides the cumulative total return of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and other indices from December 28, 2002, to December 29, 2007. The cumulative total return is the return on investment including reinvestment of dividends.

To find the return on investment for the specific period from 2006 to 2007, we can calculate the return for the given period and then subtract the return for the previous period (2005 to 2006) from it.

The return for the period from 2006 to 2007 can be calculated as follows:

Return_2006_2007 = (Ending_value_2007 / Beginning_value_2006) - 1

From the provided table, we can see that the beginning value for 2006 is 147.04 and the ending value for 2007 is 139.82.

Return_2006_2007 = (139.82 / 147.04) - 1
Return_2006_2007 = 0.9497 - 1
Return_2006_2007 = -0.0503

The return on investment for the period from 2006 to 2007 is -5.03%.

Therefore, the ROI of an investment in Cadence Design Systems from 2006 to 2007 is -5.03%.

                To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = (58620 / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = 0.2931 * 100

                percentage_change = 29.31%

53,"what is the total return if $ 1000000 are invested in nasdaq composite in 2009 and sold in 2010?","39.32%","<REASONING>
To calculate the total return, we can use the formula:

total_return = (final_value / initial_value) - 1

Substituting the given values from the table for the Nasdaq Composite index for the date 1/3/2009 and 1/2/2010:

initial_value = 100
final_value = 139.32

total_return = (139.32 / 100) - 1

total_return = 1.3932 - 1

total_return = 0.3932

To express the total return as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

total_return_percentage = 0.3932 * 100

total_return_percentage = 39.32%

Therefore, the total return if $10,000,000 were invested in the Nasdaq Composite in 2009 and sold in 2010 would be 39.32%.

            In 2008, the net cash from operating activities was $200,000.

                To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

                percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = (58620 / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = 0.2931 * 100

                percentage_change = 29.31%

                Therefore, the percentage change in the net cash from operating activities from 2008 to 2009 is 29.31%.

To find the pre-tax earnings in 2012, we can look at the table provided in the context. The table shows the pre-tax earnings for the year ended December 2012 as $32,250 million.

To find the pre-tax earnings in billions, we can divide the pre-tax earnings in millions by 1,000.

pre-tax earnings in billions = pre-tax earnings in millions / 1000
pre-tax earnings in billions = 32250 / 1000
pre-tax earnings in billions = 32.25

Therefore, the pre-tax earnings were $32.25 billion in 2012.

56,"what percentage of total net revenues investing & lending segment were attributable to equity securities in 2013?","56.04%","<REASONING>
To find the percentage of total net revenues in the investing & lending segment that were attributable to equity securities in 2013, we can use the following formula:

percentage = (equity_securities / total_net_revenues) * 100

From the provided context, we can extract the following values:

equity_securities = $39,300 (from the table for the year ended December 2013)
total_net_revenues = $70,180 (from the table for the year ended December 2013)

Substituting these values into the formula:

percentage = ($39,300 / $70,180) * 100

percentage = 0.5604 * 100

percentage = 56.04%

Therefore, the percentage of total net revenues in the investing & lending segment that were attributable to equity securities in 2013 is 56.04%.

management 2019s discussion and analysis net revenues in equities were $ 8.21 billion for 2012 , essentially unchanged compared with 2011 .
net revenues in securities services were significantly higher compared with 2011 , reflecting a gain of $ 494 million on the sale of our hedge fund administration business .
in addition , equities client execution net revenues were higher than 2011 , primarily reflecting significantly higher results in cash products , principally due to increased levels of client activity .
these increases were offset by lower commissions and fees , reflecting declines in the united states , europe and asia .
our average daily volumes during 2012 were lower in each of these regions compared with 2011 , consistent with listed cash equity market volumes .
during 2012 , equities operated in an environment generally characterized by an increase in global equity prices and lower volatility levels .
the net loss attributable to the impact of changes in our own credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected was $ 714 million ( $ 433 million and $ 281 million related to fixed income , currency and commodities client execution and equities client execution , respectively ) for 2012 , compared with a net gain of $ 596 million ( $ 399 million and $ 197 million related to fixed income , currency and commodities client execution and equities client execution , respectively ) for 2011 .
during 2012 , institutional client services operated in an environment generally characterized by continued broad market concerns and uncertainties , although positive developments helped to improve market conditions .
these developments included certain central bank actions to ease monetary policy and address funding risks for european financial institutions .
in addition , the u.s .
economy posted stable to improving economic data , including favorable developments in unemployment and housing .
these improvements resulted in tighter credit spreads , higher global equity prices and lower levels of volatility .
however , concerns about the outlook for the global economy and continued political uncertainty , particularly the political debate in the united states surrounding the fiscal cliff , generally resulted in client risk aversion and lower activity levels .
also , uncertainty over financial regulatory reform persisted .
operating expenses were $ 12.48 billion for 2012 , 3% ( 3 % ) lower than 2011 , primarily due to lower brokerage , clearing , exchange and distribution fees , and lower impairment charges , partially offset by higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings .
pre- tax earnings were $ 5.64 billion in 2012 , 27% ( 27 % ) higher than 2011 .
investing & lending investing & lending includes our investing activities and the origination of loans to provide financing to clients .
these investments , some of which are consolidated , and loans are typically longer-term in nature .
we make investments , directly and indirectly through funds that we manage , in debt securities and loans , public and private equity securities , and real estate entities .

2013 versus 2012 .
net revenues in investing & lending were $ 7.02 billion for 2013 , 19% ( 19 % ) higher than 2012 , reflecting a significant increase in net gains from investments in equity securities , driven by company-specific events and stronger corporate performance , as well as significantly higher global equity prices .
in addition , net gains and net interest income from debt securities and loans were slightly higher , while other net revenues , related to our consolidated investments , were lower compared with 2012 .
if equity markets decline or credit spreads widen , net revenues in investing & lending would likely be negatively impacted .
operating expenses were $ 2.68 billion for 2013 , essentially unchanged compared with 2012 .
operating expenses during 2013 included lower impairment charges and lower operating expenses related to consolidated investments , partially offset by increased compensation and benefits expenses due to higher net revenues compared with 2012 .
pre-tax earnings were $ 4.33 billion in 2013 , 34% ( 34 % ) higher than 2012 .

57,"what percentage of the total purchase consideration is comprised of goodwill and identifiable intangibles assets acquired?","61.97%","<REASONING>
To calculate the percentage of the total purchase consideration that is comprised of goodwill and identifiable intangibles assets acquired, we can use the following formula:

percentage = (goodwill + identifiable intangibles assets acquired) / total purchase consideration

From the provided context, we have the following values:

goodwill = $247,482
identifiable intangibles assets acquired = $10,8867
total purchase consideration = $416,956

Substituting these values into the formula:

percentage = ($247,482 + $10,8867) / $416,956

percentage = $258,349 / $416,956

percentage = 0.6197

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

percentage = 0.6197 * 100

percentage = 61.97%

Therefore, the percentage of the total purchase consideration that is comprised of goodwill and identifiable intangibles assets acquired is 61.97%.

58,"what portion of equity compensation plan is to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options warrants and rights?","48.03%","<REASONING>
To determine the portion of equity compensation plan that is to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights, we need to look at the table provided in the context. The relevant information is in the column labeled ""number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights (1) (a) (b)"".

From the table, we can see that the total number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights is 19550,024.

To find the portion of the equity compensation plan that is to be issued, we need to know the total number of securities available for issuance under the equity compensation plans. This information is in the column labeled ""number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans (excluding securities reflected in column (a)) (c)"".

From the table, we can see that the total number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans is 40,780,093.

To calculate the portion of the equity compensation plan that is to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights, we can divide the number of securities to be issued by the total number of securities remaining available for future issuance:

portion = (19550,024 / 40,780,093) * 100

portion = 0.4803 * 100

portion = 48.03%

Therefore, the portion of the equity compensation plan that is to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights is 48.03%.

59,"what was the change in the total commitments to extend credit from 2016 top 2017","$143,660,000,000","<REASONING>
To calculate the change in the total commitments to extend credit from 2016 to 2017, we can use the given table data.

From the table, we can see that the total commitments to extend credit as of December 31, 2016, was $15,981 million, and as of December 31, 2017, it was $159,641 million.

To find the change, we subtract the 2016 value from the 2017 value:

Change = 2017 value - 2016 value
Change = $159,641 million - $15,981 million
Change = $143,660 million

Therefore, the change in the total commitments to extend credit from 2016 to 2017 is $143,660 million.

60,"what was the percentage total return for delphi automotive plc for the three years ended december 31 2013?\\n","185.71%","<REASONING>
To calculate the percentage total return for Delphi Automotive PLC for the three years ended December 31, 2013, we need to use the formula:

total_return = (final_value + dividends) / initial_value - 1

We can calculate the total return for each year and then find the cumulative total return for the three years.

For 2011 to 2012:
initial_value = $100.00
final_value = $179.33
dividend = $0 (no dividend was paid in 2011)
total_return_2011_to_2012 = ($179.33 / $100.00) - 1 = 0.7933

For 2012 to 2013:
initial_value = $179.33
final_value = $285.81
dividend = $0.17 * 4 = $0.68 (quarterly dividend of $0.17 paid in each quarter of 2013)
total_return_2012_to_2013 = ($285.81 + $0.68) / $179.33 - 1 = 0.5945

For 2011 to 2013:
total_return_2011_to_2013 = (total_return_2011_to_2012) * (total_return_2012_to_2013) + 1 = (1.7933 * 1.5945) + 1 = 2.8571

Therefore, the percentage total return for Delphi Automotive PLC for the three years ended December 31, 2013, is 185.71%.

61,"what was percent of the remaining authorization to repurchase of the 2007 authorized the purchase at december 2010","54%","<REASONING>
To find the percentage of the remaining authorization to repurchase of the 2007 authorized the purchase at December 2010, we need to calculate the percentage of the remaining authorization out of the total authorization.

The total authorization in 2007 was 50 million shares, and the remaining authorization at December 2010 was 27 million shares.

percentage = (remaining_authorization / total_authorization) * 100

Substituting the given values:

total_authorization = 50,000,000
remaining_authorization = 27,000,000

percentage = (27,000,000 / 50,000,000) * 100

percentage = 0.54 * 100

percentage = 54%

Therefore, the percentage of the remaining authorization to repurchase of the 2007 authorized the purchase at December 2010 is 54%.

62,"what was the percentage cumulative total shareholder return on masco common stock for the five year period ended 2010?","-48.49%","<REASONING>
To calculate the percentage cumulative total shareholder return on Masco common stock for the five-year period ended 2010, we need to use the formula:

total_return = (final_value / initial_value) - 1

where final_value is the value of the investment at the end of the period (December 31, 2010) and initial_value is the initial investment (December 31, 2005).

From the table provided, we can see that the initial investment was $100 and the final value was $51.51.

total_return = (51.51 / 100) - 1
total_return = 0.5151 - 1
total_return = -0.4849

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

total_return_percentage = total_return * 100
total_return_percentage = -0.4849 * 100
total_return_percentage = -48.49%

Therefore, the percentage cumulative total shareholder return on Masco common stock for the five-year period ended 2010 was -48.49%.

To compare this to the returns of the S&P 500 index, the S&P Industrials index, and the S&P Consumer Durables & Apparel index, we can use the same formula:

S&P 500 index: (111.89 / 100) - 1 = 0.1189 or 11.89%
S&P Industrials index: (116.64 / 100) - 1 = 0.1664 or 16.64%
S&P Consumer Durables & Apparel index: (99.87 / 100) - 1 = -0.0013 or -0.13%

The cumulative total shareholder return on Masco common stock was lower than the returns of the S&P 500 index, the S&P Industrials index, and the S&P Consumer Durables & Apparel index.

To calculate the 5-year return of JPMorgan Chase's stock, we can use the formula:

return = (final_value / initial_value) - 1

Substituting the given values from the table:

initial_value = $100
final_value = $298.31

return = (298.31 / 100) - 1

return = 2.9831 - 1

return = 1.9831

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

return = 1.9831 * 100

return = 198.31%

Therefore, the 5-year return of JPMorgan Chase's stock is 198.31%.

To calculate the percentage change in inventories at FIFO net during 2012, we can use the formula:

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values from the context:

old_value = 1941055
new_value = 2182419

percentage_change = ((2182419 - 1941055) / 1941055) * 100

percentage_change = (241364 / 1941055) * 100

percentage_change = 0.1245 * 100

in both choices , an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income , each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income , and a total amount for comprehensive income .
this update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity .
the amendments in this update do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income .
the amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively and is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 , 2011 .
the company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2012 .
the adoption of asu 2011-05 is for presentation purposes only and had no material impact on the company 2019s consolidated financial statements .

inventories , net : merchandise inventory the company used the lifo method of accounting for approximately 95% ( 95 % ) of inventories at both december 29 , 2012 and december 31 , 2011 .
under lifo , the company 2019s cost of sales reflects the costs of the most recently purchased inventories , while the inventory carrying balance represents the costs for inventories purchased in fiscal 2012 and prior years .
the company recorded a reduction to cost of sales of $ 24087 and $ 29554 in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2010 , respectively .
as a result of utilizing lifo , the company recorded an increase to cost of sales of $ 24708 for fiscal 2011 , due to an increase in supply chain costs and inflationary pressures affecting certain product categories .
the company 2019s overall costs to acquire inventory for the same or similar products have generally decreased historically as the company has been able to leverage its continued growth , execution of merchandise strategies and realization of supply chain efficiencies .
product cores the remaining inventories are comprised of product cores , the non-consumable portion of certain parts and batteries , which are valued under the first-in , first-out ( ""fifo"" ) method .
product cores are included as part of the company's merchandise costs and are either passed on to the customer or returned to the vendor .
because product cores are not subject to frequent cost changes like the company's other merchandise inventory , there is no material difference when applying either the lifo or fifo valuation method .
inventory overhead costs purchasing and warehousing costs included in inventory at december 29 , 2012 and december 31 , 2011 , were $ 134258 and $ 126840 , respectively .
inventory balance and inventory reserves inventory balances at the end of fiscal 2012 and 2011 were as follows : december 29 , december 31 .

sales from existing businesses in the segment 2019s transportation technologies businesses grew at a high-single digit rate during 2016 as compared to 2015 , due primarily to strong demand for dispenser , payment and point-of-sale systems , environmental compliance products as well as vehicle and fleet management products , partly offset by weaker year-over-year demand for compressed natural gas products .
as expected , beginning in the second half of 2016 , the business began to experience reduced emv-related demand for indoor point-of-sale solutions , as customers had largely upgraded to products that support indoor emv requirements in the prior year in response to the indoor liability shift .
however , demand increased on a year-over-year basis for dispensers and payment systems as customers in the united states continued to upgrade equipment driven primarily by the emv deadlines related to outdoor payment systems .
geographically , sales from existing businesses continued to increase on a year-over-year basis in the united states and to a lesser extent in asia and western europe .
sales from existing businesses in the segment 2019s automation & specialty components business declined at a low-single digit rate during 2016 as compared to 2015 .
the businesses experienced sequential year-over-year improvement in demand during the second half of 2016 as compared to the first half of 2016 .
during 2016 , year-over-year demand declined for engine retarder products due primarily to weakness in the north american heavy-truck market , partly offset by strong growth in china and europe .
in addition , year-over-year demand declined in certain medical and defense related end markets which were partly offset by increased year-over-year demand for industrial automation products particularly in china .
geographically , sales from existing businesses in the segment 2019s automation & specialty components businesses declined in north america , partly offset by growth in western europe and china .
sales from existing businesses in the segment 2019s franchise distribution business grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2016 , as compared to 2015 , due primarily to continued net increases in franchisees as well as continued growth in demand for professional tool products and tool storage products , primarily in the united states .
this growth was partly offset by year- over-year declines in wheel service equipment sales during 2016 .
operating profit margins increased 70 basis points during 2016 as compared to 2015 .
the following factors favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons : 2022 higher 2016 sales volumes , pricing improvements , incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives and the incrementally favorable impact of the impairment of certain tradenames used in the segment in 2015 and 2016 , net of costs associated with various growth investments , product development and sales and marketing growth investments , higher year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and changes in currency exchange rates : 65 basis points 2022 the incremental net accretive effect in 2016 of acquired businesses : 5 basis points cost of sales and gross profit .

To calculate the growth rate in net revenue in 2016, we can use the formula:

growth_rate = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values from the table:

old_value = 5829
new_value = 6179

growth_rate = ((6179 - 5829) / 5829) * 100

growth_rate = (350 / 5829) * 100

            <CONTEXT>
            In 2008, the net cash from operating activities was $200,000.

            <REASONING>
                To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

                percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = (58620 / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = 0.2931 * 100

                percentage_change = 29.31%

                Therefore, the percentage change in the net cash from operating activities from 2008 to 2009 is 29.31%.

To calculate the percentage change in the weighted average grant date fair value per share of restricted stock from 2016 to 2017, we can use the formula:

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 73.20
new_value = 84.53

percentage_change = ((84.53 - 73.20) / 73.20) * 100

percentage_change = (11.33 / 73.20) * 100

percentage_change = 0.1547 * 100

percentage_change = 15.47%

Therefore, the percentage change in the weighted average grant date fair value per share of restricted stock from 2016 to 2017 is 15.47%.

68,"what is the growth rate of operating expenses from 2009 to 2010?","No, the growth rate of operating expenses from 2009 to 2010 cannot be determined from the given context.","<REASONING>
To calculate the growth rate of operating expenses from 2009 to 2010, we need to first find the operating expenses for both years. From the provided context, we can see that the operating profit for the segment decreased by 1% in 2010 compared to 2009. However, the context does not provide the actual operating expenses for 2009 and 2010. It only provides the operating profit for the segment, which is the operating revenue minus the operating expenses.

Since we cannot calculate the growth rate of operating expenses without the actual operating expenses, we cannot provide a numerical answer.

However, we can infer that the growth rate of operating expenses cannot be determined from the given context.

            <CONTEXT>
            In 2008, the net cash from operating activities was $200,000.
            In 2009, the net cash from operating activities was $258,620.

        <OUTPUT>
            <REASONING>
                To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

                percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = (58620 / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = 0.2931 * 100

                percentage_change = 29.31%

                Therefore, the percentage change in the net cash from operating activities from 2008 to 2009 is 29.31%.

net sales for space systems decreased by 5% ( 5 % ) in 2010 compared to 2009 .
sales declined in all three lines of business during the year .
the $ 253 million decrease in space transportation principally was due to lower volume on the space shuttle external tank , commercial launch vehicle activity and other human space flight programs , which partially were offset by higher volume on the orion program .
there were no commercial launches in 2010 compared to one commercial launch in 2009 .
strategic & defensive missile systems ( s&dms ) sales declined $ 147 million principally due to lower volume on defensive missile programs .
the $ 8 million sales decline in satellites primarily was attributable to lower volume on commercial satellites , which partially were offset by higher volume on government satellite activities .
there was one commercial satellite delivery in 2010 and one commercial satellite delivery in 2009 .
net sales for space systems increased 8% ( 8 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 .
during the year , sales growth at satellites and space transportation offset a decline in s&dms .
the sales growth of $ 707 million in satellites was due to higher volume in government satellite activities , which partially was offset by lower volume in commercial satellite activities .
there was one commercial satellite delivery in 2009 and two deliveries in 2008 .
the increase in sales of $ 21 million in space transportation primarily was due to higher volume on the orion program , which more than offset a decline in the space shuttle 2019s external tank program .
there was one commercial launch in both 2009 and 2008 .
s&dms 2019 sales decreased by $ 102 million mainly due to lower volume on defensive missile programs , which more than offset growth in strategic missile programs. .

net sales for space systems decreased by 5% ( 5 % ) in 2010 compared to 2009 .
sales declined in all three lines of business during the year .
the $ 253 million decrease in space transportation principally was due to lower volume on the space shuttle external tank , commercial launch vehicle activity and other human space flight programs , which partially were offset by higher volume on the orion program .
there were no commercial launches in 2010 compared to one commercial launch in 2009 .
strategic & defensive missile systems ( s&dms ) sales declined $ 147 million principally due to lower volume on defensive missile programs .
the $ 8 million sales decline in satellites primarily was attributable to lower volume on commercial satellites , which partially were offset by higher volume on government satellite activities .
there was one commercial satellite delivery in 2010 and one commercial satellite delivery in 2009 .
net sales for space systems increased 8% ( 8 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 .
during the year , sales growth at satellites and space transportation offset a decline in s&dms .
the sales growth of $ 707 million in satellites was due to higher volume in government satellite activities , which partially was offset by lower volume in commercial satellite activities .
there was one commercial satellite delivery in 2009 and two deliveries in 2008 .
the increase in sales of $ 21 million in space transportation primarily was due to higher volume on the orion program , which more than offset a decline in the space shuttle 2019s external tank program .
there was one commercial launch in both 2009 and 2008 .
s&dms 2019 sales decreased by $ 102 million mainly due to lower volume on defensive missile programs , which more than offset growth in strategic missile programs. .

69,"what is the expected growth rate in operating leases from 2020 to 2021?","0.69%","<REASONING>
To calculate the expected growth rate in operating leases from 2020 to 2021, we can use the formula:

growth_rate = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value)

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 1888 (operating leases in 2020)
new_value = 1901 (operating leases in 2021)

growth_rate = ((1901 - 1888) / 1888)

growth_rate = (13 / 1888)

growth_rate = 0.0069

To express the growth rate as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

growth_rate = 0.0069 * 100

growth_rate = 0.69%

Therefore, the expected growth rate in operating leases from 2020 to 2021 is 0.69%.

70,"as of year ended december 31 2015 what is the value of the shares granted","Not provided","<REASONING>
To find the value of the shares granted as of year ended December 31, 2015, we need to look at the table provided in the context, which summarizes the status of the company's non-vested performance share unit awards for the period indicated.

The table shows the following information:

- Outstanding at January 1, 2015: Not provided
- Granted: 10,705 shares with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $178.84
- Vested: Not provided
- Forfeited: Not provided
- Outstanding at December 31, 2015: 10,705 shares with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $178.84

Since the question asks for the value of the shares granted as of year ended December 31, 2015, we can see that the value of the shares granted is the same as the weighted-average grant date fair value of the shares granted, which is $178.84 per share.

Therefore, the total value of the shares granted as of year ended December 31, 2015, is 10,705 shares * $178.84 per share.

However, the context does not provide the total value of the shares granted as of year ended December 31, 2015. It only provides the weighted-average grant date fair value of the shares granted, which is $178.84 per share, and the number of shares granted, which is 10,705 shares.

Therefore, we cannot calculate the total value of the shares granted as of year ended December 31, 2015, based on the provided context.

To calculate the percentage change in operating income from 2005 to 2006, we can use the formula:

percentage_ change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 123715
new_value = 302644

percentage_ change = ((302644 - 123715) / 123715) * 100

percentage_ change = (178929 / 123715) * 100

percentage_ change = 1.447 * 100

percentage_ change = 144.7%

Therefore, the percentage change in operating income from 2005 to 2006 is 144.7%.

73,"what is the net margin for 2006?","5.53%","<REASONING>
To calculate the net margin for 2006, we need to use the net income and total revenues from the given context. The net income for 2006 is $259.1 million, and the total revenues for 2006 are $24,587,777.

The net margin formula is:

net margin = (net income / total revenues) * 100

Substituting the given values:

net income = 259,100,000
total revenues = 24,587,777

net margin = (259,100,000 / 24,587,777) * 100

net margin = 1.053 * 100

net margin = 5.53%

Therefore, the net margin for 2006 is 5.53%.

            In 2008, the net cash from operating activities was $200,000.

        <OUTPUT>
            <REASONING>
                To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

                percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = (58620 / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = 0.2931 * 100

                percentage_change = 29.31%

                Therefore, the percentage change in the net cash from operating activities from 2008 to 2009 is 29.31%.

To find the percentage of net sales of printing papers in Brazil for 2013, we need to look for the relevant information in the provided context. The context contains a table with sales data for different regions, including Brazil, for the years 2012, 2013, and 2014.

From the table, we can see that the net sales for Brazil in 2013 were $1.1 billion.

To find the percentage, we need to know the total net sales for printing papers in 2013. However, the total net sales for printing papers in 2013 are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. But we can find the total net sales for printing papers in 2014, which is $5,720 million.

growth_rate = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values from the table for Entergy New Orleans, Inc.:

old_value = 243.0 (2009 net revenue)
new_value = 272.9 (2010 net revenue)

growth_rate = ((272.9 - 243.0) / 243.0) * 100

growth_rate = (29.9 / 243.0) * 100

growth_rate = 0.1235 * 100

growth_rate = 12.35%

Therefore, the growth rate in net revenue from 2009 to 2010 for Entergy New Orleans, Inc. is 12.35%.

and subsidiaries management 2019s financial discussion and analysis gross operating revenues , fuel and purchased power expenses , and other regulatory charges gross operating revenues increased primarily due to the base rate increases and the volume/weather effect , as discussed above .
fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to an increase in demand coupled with an increase in deferred fuel expense as a result of lower fuel refunds in 2011 versus 2010 , partially offset by a decrease in the average market price of natural gas .
other regulatory charges decreased primarily due to the distribution in the first quarter 2011 of $ 17.4 million to customers of the 2007 rough production cost equalization remedy receipts .
see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rough production cost equalization proceedings .

the net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to increased sales to municipal and co-op customers due to the addition of new contracts .
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to increased electricity usage primarily in the residential and commercial sectors , resulting from a 1.5% ( 1.5 % ) increase in customers , coupled with the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales .
billed electricity usage increased a total of 777 gwh , or 5% ( 5 % ) .
the rough production cost equalization variance is due to an additional $ 18.6 million allocation recorded in the second quarter of 2009 for 2007 rough production cost equalization receipts ordered by the puct to texas retail customers over what was originally allocated to entergy texas prior to the jurisdictional separation of entergy gulf states , inc .
into entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy texas , effective december 2007 , as discussed in note 2 to the financial statements .
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to rate actions , including an annual base rate increase of $ 59 million beginning august 2010 as a result of the settlement of the december 2009 rate case .
see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement .
the securitization transition charge variance is due to the issuance of securitization bonds .
in november 2009 , entergy texas restoration funding , llc , a company wholly-owned and consolidated by entergy texas , issued securitization bonds and with the proceeds purchased from entergy texas the transition property , which is the right to recover from customers through a transition charge amounts sufficient to service the securitization bonds .
the securitization transition charge is offset with a corresponding increase in interest on long-term debt with no impact on net income .
see note 5 to the financial statements for further discussion of the securitization bond issuance. .

management 2019s financial discussion and analysis the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in electricity usage in the residential and commercial sectors due in part to a 4% ( 4 % ) increase in the average number of residential customers and a 3% ( 3 % ) increase in the average number of commercial customers , partially offset by the effect of less favorable weather on residential sales .
gross operating revenues gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to : a decrease of $ 16.2 million in electric fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates ; a decrease of $ 15.4 million in gross gas revenues primarily due to lower fuel cost recovery revenues as a result of lower fuel rates and the effect of milder weather ; and formula rate plan decreases effective october 2010 and october 2011 , as discussed above .

To find the sum of the payments related to the hardboard, omniwood, and woodruf settlements for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, we can look at the ""payments"" row in the table provided in the context.

The table shows the following payments:

-78 (78) for 2006
-87 (87) for 2007
-38 (38) for 2008

To find the total sum of the payments, we can add these values together:

-78 + (-87) + (-38) = -203

Therefore, the sum of the payments related to the hardboard, omniwood, and woodruf settlements for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 is -$203 million.

the company resolved five of the eight pending lawsuits arising from this matter and believes that it has adequate insurance to resolve remaining matters .
the company believes that the settlement of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements .
during the 2009 third quarter , in connection with an environmental site remediation action under cer- cla , international paper submitted to the epa a feasibility study for this site .
the epa has indicated that it intends to select a proposed remedial action alternative from those identified in the study and present this proposal for public comment .
since it is not currently possible to determine the final remedial action that will be required , the company has accrued , as of december 31 , 2009 , an estimate of the minimum costs that could be required for this site .
when the remediation plan is finalized by the epa , it is possible that the remediation costs could be sig- nificantly higher than amounts currently recorded .
exterior siding and roofing litigation international paper has established reserves relating to the settlement , during 1998 and 1999 , of three nationwide class action lawsuits against the com- pany and masonite corp. , a former wholly-owned subsidiary of the company .
those settlements relate to ( 1 ) exterior hardboard siding installed during the 1980 2019s and 1990 2019s ( the hardboard claims ) ; ( 2 ) omniwood siding installed during the 1990 2019s ( the omniwood claims ) ; and ( 3 ) woodruf roofing installed during the 1980 2019s and 1990 2019s ( the woodruf claims ) .
all hardboard claims were required to be made by january 15 , 2008 , while all omniwood and woodruf claims were required to be made by jan- uary 6 , 2009 .

the company believes that the aggregate reserve balance remaining at december 31 , 2009 is adequate to cover the final settlement of remaining claims .
summary the company is also involved in various other inquiries , administrative proceedings and litigation relating to contracts , sales of property , intellectual property , environmental and safety matters , tax , personal injury , labor and employment and other matters , some of which allege substantial monetary damages .
while any proceeding or litigation has the element of uncertainty , the company believes that the outcome of any of the lawsuits or claims that are pending or threatened , or all of them combined , will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements .
note 12 variable interest entities and preferred securities of subsidiaries variable interest entities in connection with the 2006 sale of approximately 5.6 million acres of forestlands , international paper received installment notes ( the timber notes ) total- ing approximately $ 4.8 billion .
the timber notes , which do not require principal payments prior to their august 2016 maturity , are supported by irrev- ocable letters of credit obtained by the buyers of the forestlands .
during the 2006 fourth quarter , interna- tional paper contributed the timber notes to newly formed entities ( the borrower entities ) in exchange for class a and class b interests in these entities .
subsequently , international paper contributed its $ 200 million class a interests in the borrower enti- ties , along with approximately $ 400 million of international paper promissory notes , to other newly formed entities ( the investor entities ) in exchange for class a and class b interests in these entities , and simultaneously sold its class a interest in the investor entities to a third party investor .
as a result , at december 31 , 2006 , international paper held class b interests in the borrower entities and class b interests in the investor entities valued at approx- imately $ 5.0 billion .
international paper has no obligation to make any further capital contributions to these entities and did not provide financial or other support during 2009 , 2008 or 2007 that was not previously contractually required .
based on an analysis of these entities under guidance that considers the potential magnitude of the variability in the structure and which party bears a majority of the gains or losses , international paper determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these entities .

77,"in 2009 what was the percentage of the total loans sold that was from commercial mortagages","22.35%","<REASONING>
To find the percentage of total loans sold that was from commercial mortgages in 2009, we need to first find the total amount of loans sold in 2009 and the amount of commercial mortgage loans sold in 2009.

From the context, we can see that the total amount of loans sold in 2009 is $19.8 billion (residential) + $5.7 billion (commercial) = $25.5 billion.

The amount of commercial mortgage loans sold in 2009 is $5.7 billion.

To find the percentage, we can use the formula:

percentage = (part / whole) * 100

In this case, the part is the amount of commercial mortgage loans sold ($5.7 billion) and the whole is the total amount of loans sold ($25.5 billion).

percentage = ($5.7 billion / $25.5 billion) * 100

percentage = 0.22352941176 * 100

percentage = 22.35%

Therefore, the percentage of total loans sold that was from commercial mortgages in 2009 is 22.35%.

note 10 loan sales and securitizations loan sales we sell residential and commercial mortgage loans in loan securitization transactions sponsored by government national mortgage association ( gnma ) , fnma , and fhlmc and in certain instances to other third-party investors .
gnma , fnma , and the fhlmc securitize our transferred loans into mortgage-backed securities for sale into the secondary market .
generally , we do not retain any interest in the transferred loans other than mortgage servicing rights .
refer to note 9 goodwill and other intangible assets for further discussion on our residential and commercial mortgage servicing rights assets .
during 2009 , residential and commercial mortgage loans sold totaled $ 19.8 billion and $ 5.7 billion , respectively .
during 2008 , commercial mortgage loans sold totaled $ 3.1 billion .
there were no residential mortgage loans sales in 2008 as these activities were obtained through our acquisition of national city .
our continuing involvement in these loan sales consists primarily of servicing and limited repurchase obligations for loan and servicer breaches in representations and warranties .
generally , we hold a cleanup call repurchase option for loans sold with servicing retained to the other third-party investors .
in certain circumstances as servicer , we advance principal and interest payments to the gses and other third-party investors and also may make collateral protection advances .
our risk of loss in these servicing advances has historically been minimal .
we maintain a liability for estimated losses on loans expected to be repurchased as a result of breaches in loan and servicer representations and warranties .
we have also entered into recourse arrangements associated with commercial mortgage loans sold to fnma and fhlmc .
refer to note 25 commitments and guarantees for further discussion on our repurchase liability and recourse arrangements .
our maximum exposure to loss in our loan sale activities is limited to these repurchase and recourse obligations .
in addition , for certain loans transferred in the gnma and fnma transactions , we hold an option to repurchase individual delinquent loans that meet certain criteria .
without prior authorization from these gses , this option gives pnc the ability to repurchase the delinquent loan at par .
under gaap , once we have the unilateral ability to repurchase the delinquent loan , effective control over the loan has been regained and we are required to recognize the loan and a corresponding repurchase liability on the balance sheet regardless of our intent to repurchase the loan .
at december 31 , 2009 and december 31 , 2008 , the balance of our repurchase option asset and liability totaled $ 577 million and $ 476 million , respectively .
securitizations in securitizations , loans are typically transferred to a qualifying special purpose entity ( qspe ) that is demonstrably distinct from the transferor to transfer the risk from our consolidated balance sheet .
a qspe is a bankruptcy-remote trust allowed to perform only certain passive activities .
in addition , these entities are self-liquidating and in certain instances are structured as real estate mortgage investment conduits ( remics ) for tax purposes .
the qspes are generally financed by issuing certificates for various levels of senior and subordinated tranches .
qspes are exempt from consolidation provided certain conditions are met .
our securitization activities were primarily obtained through our acquisition of national city .
credit card receivables , automobile , and residential mortgage loans were securitized through qspes sponsored by ncb .
these qspes were financed primarily through the issuance and sale of beneficial interests to independent third parties and were not consolidated on our balance sheet at december 31 , 2009 or december 31 , 2008 .
however , see note 1 accounting policies regarding accounting guidance that impacts the accounting for these qspes effective january 1 , 2010 .
qualitative and quantitative information about the securitization qspes and our retained interests in these transactions follow .
the following summarizes the assets and liabilities of the securitization qspes associated with securitization transactions that were outstanding at december 31 , 2009. .

during the fourth quarter of 2009 , the 2008-1 and 2008-2 credit card securitization series matured .
our continuing involvement in the securitized credit card receivables consists primarily of servicing and our holding of certain retained interests .
servicing fees earned approximate current market rates for servicing fees ; therefore , no servicing asset or liability is recognized .
we hold a clean-up call repurchase option to the extent a securitization series extends past its scheduled note principal payoff date .
to the extent this occurs , the clean-up call option is triggered when the principal balance of the asset- backed notes of any series reaches 5% ( 5 % ) of the initial principal balance of the asset-backed notes issued at the securitization .

To find the total cash dividend declared from 2016 to 2018, we can directly extract the relevant information from the provided context.

The context states that cash dividends declared were $468.4 million, $446.3 million, and $423.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

To find the total cash dividend declared from 2016 to 2018, we can add these three values together:

Total cash dividend declared = $423.8 million (2016) + $446.3 million (2017) + $468.4 million (2018)

80,"considering the year 2018 , what is the percentage of the cash dividend paid per share concerning the total amount paid per share?","0.000675%","<REASONING>
To calculate the percentage of the cash dividend paid per share concerning the total amount paid per share for the year 2018, we can use the following formula:

percentage = (dividend_per_share / total_amount_per_share) * 100

From the provided context, we can find the values for dividend_per_share and total_amount_per_share for the year 2018.

dividend_per_share = $1.90 (as per the table in the context)
total_amount_per_share = $262 million / number_of_shares (we need to find the number_of_shares)

However, the number_of_shares is not provided in the context. But we can find it using the total_amount_per_share for the year 2016 and 2017.

For 2016: total_amount_per_share = $172 million
For 2017: total_amount_per_share = $216 million

Assuming the number_of_shares remains constant for all three years, we can calculate the number_of_shares using the data for 2016.

number_of_shares = total_amount_per_share_2016 / amount_per_share_2016
number_of_shares = $172 million / $1.16
number_of_shares = 148,276,724

Now, we can calculate the total_amount_per_share for 2018 using the number_of_shares.

total_amount_per_share_2018 = number_of_shares * amount_per_share_2018
total_amount_per_share_2018 = 148,276,724 * $1.90
total_amount_per_share_2018 = $281,322,277.6

Now, we can calculate the percentage.

percentage = (dividend_per_share / total_amount_per_share) * 100
percentage = ($1.90 / $281,322,277.6) * 100
percentage = 0.00000675 * 100
percentage = 0.000675%

Therefore, the percentage of the cash dividend paid per share concerning the total amount paid per share for the year 2018 is 0.000675%.

To calculate the percentage change in the balance of total investments GAAP from 2011 to 2012, we can use the formula:

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values from the table:

old_value = 1631 (total investments GAAP at December 31, 2011)
new_value = 1750 (total investments GAAP at December 31, 2012)

percentage_change = ((1750 - 1631) / 1631) * 100

percentage_change = (119 / 1631) * 100

percentage_change = 0.0730 * 100

percentage_change = 7.30%

Therefore, the percentage change in the balance of total investments GAAP from 2011 to 2012 is 7.30%.

To find the percentage of the total assets of the disposal group that were attributable to receivables net, we can use the following formula:

percentage = (part / whole) * 100

From the provided context, we can see that the total assets of the disposal group were $4130 million and the receivables net were $807 million.

Substituting the given values into the formula:

percentage = ($807 / $4130) * 100

percentage = 0.1956 * 100

percentage = 19.56%

Therefore, the percentage of the total assets of the disposal group that were attributable to receivables net is 19.56%.

divestiture of the information systems & global solutions business on august 16 , 2016 , we completed the previously announced divestiture of the is&gs business , which merged with a subsidiary of leidos , in a reverse morris trust transaction ( the 201ctransaction 201d ) .
the transaction was completed in a multi- step process pursuant to which we initially contributed the is&gs business to abacus innovations corporation ( abacus ) , a wholly owned subsidiary of lockheed martin created to facilitate the transaction , and the common stock of abacus was distributed to participating lockheed martin stockholders through an exchange offer .
under the terms of the exchange offer , lockheed martin stockholders had the option to exchange shares of lockheed martin common stock for shares of abacus common stock .
at the conclusion of the exchange offer , all shares of abacus common stock were exchanged for 9369694 shares of lockheed martin common stock held by lockheed martin stockholders that elected to participate in the exchange .
the shares of lockheed martin common stock that were exchanged and accepted were retired , reducing the number of shares of our common stock outstanding by approximately 3% ( 3 % ) .
following the exchange offer , abacus merged with a subsidiary of leidos , with abacus continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of leidos .
as part of the merger , each share of abacus common stock was automatically converted into one share of leidos common stock .
we did not receive any shares of leidos common stock as part of the transaction and do not hold any shares of leidos or abacus common stock following the transaction .
based on an opinion of outside tax counsel , subject to customary qualifications and based on factual representations , the exchange offer and merger will qualify as tax-free transactions to lockheed martin and its stockholders , except to the extent that cash was paid to lockheed martin stockholders in lieu of fractional shares .
in connection with the transaction , abacus borrowed an aggregate principal amount of approximately $ 1.84 billion under term loan facilities with third party financial institutions , the proceeds of which were used to make a one-time special cash payment of $ 1.80 billion to lockheed martin and to pay associated borrowing fees and expenses .
the entire special cash payment was used to repay debt , pay dividends and repurchase stock during the third and fourth quarters of 2016 .
the obligations under the abacus term loan facilities were guaranteed by leidos as part of the transaction .
as a result of the transaction , we recognized a net gain of approximately $ 1.2 billion .
the net gain represents the $ 2.5 billion fair value of the shares of lockheed martin common stock exchanged and retired as part of the exchange offer , plus the $ 1.8 billion one-time special cash payment , less the net book value of the is&gs business of about $ 3.0 billion at august 16 , 2016 and other adjustments of about $ 100 million .
the final gain is subject to certain post-closing adjustments , including final working capital , indemnification , and tax adjustments , which we expect to complete in 2017 .

85,"what percentage of the total assets of the disposal group were attributable to goodwill?","69.7%","<REASONING>
To find the percentage of the total assets of the disposal group that were attributable to goodwill, we can use the following formula:

percentage = (goodwill / total_assets) * 100

From the provided context, we can find the values for goodwill and total assets:

goodwill = $28,811
total_assets = $41,300

Substituting the given values into the formula:

percentage = ($28,811 / $41,300) * 100

percentage = 0.697 * 100

percentage = 69.7%

Therefore, the percentage of the total assets of the disposal group that were attributable to goodwill is 69.7%.

To calculate the expected increase in the pension expense's amortization of actuarial losses in 2020, in comparison with 2019, we need to compare the values given in the context.

In 2019, the pension expense included amortization of actuarial losses of $76.2. In 2020, the expected pension expense includes approximately $105 for amortization of actuarial losses.

To find the expected increase, we subtract the 2019 value from the 2020 value:

Expected increase = 2020 value - 2019 value
Expected increase = $105 - $76.2
Expected increase = $28.8

Therefore, the expected increase in the pension expense's amortization of actuarial losses in 2020, in comparison with 2019, is $28.8.

pension expense decreased from the prior year due to lower pension settlements , lower loss amortization , primarily from favorable asset experience and the impact of higher discount rates , partially offset by lower expected returns on assets .
special items ( settlements , termination benefits , and curtailments ) decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower pension settlement losses .
in fiscal year 2019 , special items of $ 7.2 included pension settlement losses of $ 6.4 , of which $ 5.0 was recorded during the second quarter and related to the u.s .
supplementary pension plan , and $ .8 of termination benefits .
these amounts are reflected within ""other non- operating income ( expense ) , net"" on the consolidated income statements .
in fiscal year 2018 , special items of $ 48.9 included a pension settlement loss of $ 43.7 primarily in connection with the transfer of certain pension assets and payment obligations for our u.s .
salaried and hourly plans to an insurer during the fourth quarter , $ 4.8 of pension settlement losses related to lump sum payouts from the u.s .
supplementary pension plan , and $ .4 of termination benefits .
u.k .
lloyds equalization ruling on 26 october 2018 , the united kingdom high court issued a ruling related to the equalization of pension plan participants 2019 benefits for the gender effects of guaranteed minimum pensions .
as a result of this ruling , we estimated the impact of retroactively increasing benefits in our u.k .
plan in accordance with the high court ruling .
we treated the additional benefits as a prior service cost , which resulted in an increase to our projected benefit obligation and accumulated other comprehensive loss of $ 4.7 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 .
we are amortizing this cost over the average remaining life expectancy of the u.k .
participants .
2020 outlook in fiscal year 2020 , we expect pension expense to be approximately $ 5 to $ 20 , which includes expected pension settlement losses of $ 5 to $ 10 , depending on the timing of retirements .
the expected range reflects lower expected interest cost and higher total assets , partially offset by higher expected loss amortization primarily due to the impact of lower discount rates .
in fiscal year 2020 , we expect pension expense to include approximately $ 105 for amortization of actuarial losses .
in fiscal year 2019 , pension expense included amortization of actuarial losses of $ 76.2 .
net actuarial losses of $ 424.4 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in fiscal year 2019 .
actuarial ( gains ) losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses .
future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial ( gains ) losses and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2020 .
pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans , which are primarily non-qualified plans .
with respect to funded plans , our funding policy is that contributions , combined with appreciation and earnings , will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses .

pension expense decreased from the prior year due to lower pension settlements , lower loss amortization , primarily from favorable asset experience and the impact of higher discount rates , partially offset by lower expected returns on assets .
special items ( settlements , termination benefits , and curtailments ) decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower pension settlement losses .
in fiscal year 2019 , special items of $ 7.2 included pension settlement losses of $ 6.4 , of which $ 5.0 was recorded during the second quarter and related to the u.s .
supplementary pension plan , and $ .8 of termination benefits .
these amounts are reflected within ""other non- operating income ( expense ) , net"" on the consolidated income statements .
in fiscal year 2018 , special items of $ 48.9 included a pension settlement loss of $ 43.7 primarily in connection with the transfer of certain pension assets and payment obligations for our u.s .
salaried and hourly plans to an insurer during the fourth quarter , $ 4.8 of pension settlement losses related to lump sum payouts from the u.s .
supplementary pension plan , and $ .4 of termination benefits .
u.k .
lloyds equalization ruling on 26 october 2018 , the united kingdom high court issued a ruling related to the equalization of pension plan participants 2019 benefits for the gender effects of guaranteed minimum pensions .
as a result of this ruling , we estimated the impact of retroactively increasing benefits in our u.k .
plan in accordance with the high court ruling .
we treated the additional benefits as a prior service cost , which resulted in an increase to our projected benefit obligation and accumulated other comprehensive loss of $ 4.7 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 .
we are amortizing this cost over the average remaining life expectancy of the u.k .
participants .
2020 outlook in fiscal year 2020 , we expect pension expense to be approximately $ 5 to $ 20 , which includes expected pension settlement losses of $ 5 to $ 10 , depending on the timing of retirements .
the expected range reflects lower expected interest cost and higher total assets , partially offset by higher expected loss amortization primarily due to the impact of lower discount rates .
in fiscal year 2020 , we expect pension expense to include approximately $ 105 for amortization of actuarial losses .
in fiscal year 2019 , pension expense included amortization of actuarial losses of $ 76.2 .
net actuarial losses of $ 424.4 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in fiscal year 2019 .
actuarial ( gains ) losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses .
future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial ( gains ) losses and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2020 .
pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans , which are primarily non-qualified plans .
with respect to funded plans , our funding policy is that contributions , combined with appreciation and earnings , will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses .
in addition , we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions .
with the assistance of third-party actuaries , we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan , which help guide the level of contributions .
during 2019 and 2018 , our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $ 40.2 and $ 68.3 , respectively .

                To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

                percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = (58620 / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = 0.2931 * 100

                percentage_change = 29.31%

88,"what was the total cost of all shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding stock options that were approved by security holders?","$553,111,111.46","<REASONING>
To find the total cost of all shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding stock options that were approved by security holders, we need to look at the table provided in the context. The table shows the number of shares of common stock to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options for equity compensation plans approved by security holders.

From the table, we can see that the number of shares of common stock to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options for equity compensation plans approved by security holders is 34,317,386. The weighted-average exercise price of outstanding stock options for these plans is $16.11.

To find the total cost, we multiply the number of shares by the weighted-average exercise price:

Total cost = Number of shares * Weighted-average exercise price
Total cost = 34,317,386 * $16.11
Total cost = $553,111,111.46

Therefore, the total cost of all shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding stock options that were approved by security holders is $553,111,111.46.

To find the long-term debt payments in the next three years, we can look at the table provided in the context. The table shows the annual long-term debt maturities for the next five years. We are only interested in the next three years, which are 2018, 2019, and 2020.

From the table, we can see that the long-term debt payments for the next three years are as follows:

- 2018: $82,808,400
- 2019: $7,248,990
- 2020: $79,500,000

Therefore, the long-term debt payments in the next three years, in thousands, are:

- 2018: 82,808.4
- 2019: 7,248.99
- 2020: 79,500

We can round these values to the nearest whole number, as the context does not specify the precision of the answer.

- 2018: 82,808
- 2019: 7,249

residential mortgage loan and home equity repurchase obligations while residential mortgage loans are sold on a non-recourse basis , we assume certain loan repurchase obligations associated with mortgage loans we have sold to investors .
these loan repurchase obligations primarily relate to situations where pnc is alleged to have breached certain origination covenants and representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and sale agreements .
residential mortgage loans covered by these loan repurchase obligations include first and second-lien mortgage loans we have sold through agency securitizations , non-agency securitizations , and whole-loan sale transactions .
as discussed in note 3 in this report , agency securitizations consist of mortgage loans sale transactions with fnma , fhlmc , and gnma , while non-agency securitizations and whole-loan sale transactions consist of mortgage loans sale transactions with private investors .
our historical exposure and activity associated with agency securitization repurchase obligations has primarily been related to transactions with fnma and fhlmc , as indemnification and repurchase losses associated with fha and va-insured and uninsured loans pooled in gnma securitizations historically have been minimal .
repurchase obligation activity associated with residential mortgages is reported in the residential mortgage banking segment .
pnc 2019s repurchase obligations also include certain brokered home equity loans/lines that were sold to a limited number of private investors in the financial services industry by national city prior to our acquisition .
pnc is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business , and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of whole-loans sold in these transactions .
repurchase activity associated with brokered home equity loans/lines is reported in the non-strategic assets portfolio segment .
loan covenants and representations and warranties are established through loan sale agreements with various investors to provide assurance that pnc has sold loans to investors of sufficient investment quality .
key aspects of such covenants and representations and warranties include the loan 2019s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the investor , including underwriting standards , delivery of all required loan documents to the investor or its designated party , sufficient collateral valuation , and the validity of the lien securing the loan .
as a result of alleged breaches of these contractual obligations , investors may request pnc to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans .
these investor indemnification or repurchase claims are typically settled on an individual loan basis through make- whole payments or loan repurchases ; however , on occasion we may negotiate pooled settlements with investors .
indemnifications for loss or loan repurchases typically occur when , after review of the claim , we agree insufficient evidence exists to dispute the investor 2019s claim that a breach of a loan covenant and representation and warranty has occurred , such breach has not been cured , and the effect of such breach is deemed to have had a material and adverse effect on the value of the transferred loan .
depending on the sale agreement and upon proper notice from the investor , we typically respond to such indemnification and repurchase requests within 60 days , although final resolution of the claim may take a longer period of time .

    The question asks for the percentage change in commercial mortgage recourse obligations from 2010 to 2011. The context provides the necessary data to calculate this percentage change. 

    The table in the context shows the commercial mortgage recourse obligations for both 2010 and 2011. 

    To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

    percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

    Substituting the given values:

    old_value = 54 (January 1, 2010)
    new_value = 47 (December 31, 2011)

    percentage_change = ((47 - 54) / 54) * 100

    percentage_change = (-7 / 54) * 100

    percentage_change = -0.1296 * 100

    percentage_change = -12.96%

    Therefore, the percentage change in commercial mortgage recourse obligations from 2010 to 2011 is -12.96%.

residential mortgage loan and home equity repurchase obligations while residential mortgage loans are sold on a non-recourse basis , we assume certain loan repurchase obligations associated with mortgage loans we have sold to investors .
these loan repurchase obligations primarily relate to situations where pnc is alleged to have breached certain origination covenants and representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and sale agreements .
residential mortgage loans covered by these loan repurchase obligations include first and second-lien mortgage loans we have sold through agency securitizations , non-agency securitizations , and whole-loan sale transactions .
as discussed in note 3 in this report , agency securitizations consist of mortgage loans sale transactions with fnma , fhlmc , and gnma , while non-agency securitizations and whole-loan sale transactions consist of mortgage loans sale transactions with private investors .
our historical exposure and activity associated with agency securitization repurchase obligations has primarily been related to transactions with fnma and fhlmc , as indemnification and repurchase losses associated with fha and va-insured and uninsured loans pooled in gnma securitizations historically have been minimal .
repurchase obligation activity associated with residential mortgages is reported in the residential mortgage banking segment .
pnc 2019s repurchase obligations also include certain brokered home equity loans/lines that were sold to a limited number of private investors in the financial services industry by national city prior to our acquisition .
pnc is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business , and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of whole-loans sold in these transactions .
repurchase activity associated with brokered home equity loans/lines is reported in the non-strategic assets portfolio segment .
loan covenants and representations and warranties are established through loan sale agreements with various investors to provide assurance that pnc has sold loans to investors of sufficient investment quality .
key aspects of such covenants and representations and warranties include the loan 2019s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the investor , including underwriting standards , delivery of all required loan documents to the investor or its designated party , sufficient collateral valuation , and the validity of the lien securing the loan .
as a result of alleged breaches of these contractual obligations , investors may request pnc to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans .
these investor indemnification or repurchase claims are typically settled on an individual loan basis through make- whole payments or loan repurchases ; however , on occasion we may negotiate pooled settlements with investors .
indemnifications for loss or loan repurchases typically occur when , after review of the claim , we agree insufficient evidence exists to dispute the investor 2019s claim that a breach of a loan covenant and representation and warranty has occurred , such breach has not been cured , and the effect of such breach is deemed to have had a material and adverse effect on the value of the transferred loan .
depending on the sale agreement and upon proper notice from the investor , we typically respond to such indemnification and repurchase requests within 60 days , although final resolution of the claim may take a longer period of time .

92,"what percentage of net assets acquired was property plant and equipment?","76.94%","<REASONING>
To find the percentage of net assets acquired that was property, plant, and equipment, we need to divide the value of property, plant, and equipment by the total net assets acquired and multiply by 100.

From the provided context, we have the following values:

- Net assets acquired = $345.6 million
- Property, plant, and equipment = $265.9 million

Using the formula:

percentage = (property, plant, and equipment / net assets acquired) * 100

Substituting the given values:

percentage = ($265.9 / $345.6) * 100

percentage = 0.7694 * 100

percentage = 76.94%

Therefore, the percentage of net assets acquired that was property, plant, and equipment is 76.94%.

To calculate the percentage of net assets acquired that was goodwill, we can use the formula:

percentage = (goodwill / net_assets_acquired) * 100

From the provided context, we can extract the values for goodwill and net assets acquired:

goodwill = $100.2
net_assets_acquired = $345.6

Substituting the given values into the formula:

percentage = ($100.2 / $345.6) * 100

94,"what was the percent change in matching contributions between 2014 and 2016?","35.16%","<REASONING>
To calculate the percentage change in matching contributions between 2014 and 2016, we can use the formula:

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 12.8 million
new_value = 17.3 million

percentage_change = ((17.3 - 12.8) / 12.8) * 100

percentage_change = (4.5 / 12.8) * 100

percentage_change = 0.3515625 * 100

percentage_change = 35.15625%

Therefore, the percentage change in matching contributions between 2014 and 2016 is 35.16%.

To find the net change in net revenue during 2003 for Entergy Gulf States, Inc., we need to subtract the net revenue in 2003 from the net revenue in 2002.

From the provided context, we can see that the net revenue in 2002 was $1130.7 million and the net revenue in 2003 was $1110.1 million.

net_change = 2002_net_revenue - 2003_net_revenue

the volume/weather variance was due to higher electric sales volume in the service territory .
billed usage increased a total of 517 gwh in the residential and commercial sectors .
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in industrial usage of 470 gwh due to the loss of two large industrial customers to cogeneration .
the customers accounted for approximately 1% ( 1 % ) of entergy gulf states' net revenue in 2002 .
in 2002 , deferred fuel costs of $ 8.9 million related to a texas fuel reconciliation case were written off and $ 6.5 million in expense resulted from an adjustment in the deregulated asset plan percentage as the result of a power uprate at river bend .
the increase in net wholesale revenue was primarily due to an increase in sales volume to municipal and co- op customers and also to affiliated systems related to entergy's generation resource planning .
the base rate decreases were effective june 2002 and january 2003 , both in the louisiana jurisdiction .
the january 2003 base rate decrease of $ 22.1 million had a minimal impact on net income due to a corresponding reduction in nuclear depreciation and decommissioning expenses associated with the change in accounting to reflect an assumed extension of river bend's useful life .
in 2002 , a gain of $ 15.2 million was recognized for the louisiana portion of the 1988 nelson units 1 and 2 sale .
entergy gulf states received approval from the lpsc to discontinue applying amortization of the gain against recoverable fuel , resulting in the recognition of the deferred gain in income .
rate refund provisions caused a decrease in net revenue due to additional provisions recorded in 2003 compared to 2002 for potential rate actions and refunds .
gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses gross operating revenues increased primarily due to an increase of $ 440.2 million in fuel cost recovery revenues as a result of higher fuel rates in both the louisiana and texas jurisdictions .
fuel and purchased power expenses increased $ 471.1 million due to an increase in the market prices of natural gas and purchased power .
other income statement variances 2004 compared to 2003 other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to : 2022 voluntary severance program accruals of $ 22.5 million in 2003 ; and 2022 a decrease of $ 4.3 million in nuclear material and labor costs due to reduced staff in 2004. .

To find the deferred fuel costs as a percentage of the total fuel write-offs in 2002, we need to first identify the deferred fuel costs and the total fuel write-offs in 2002 from the provided context.

From the context, we can see that the deferred fuel costs in 2002 were $8.9 million, and the total fuel write-offs in 2002 were $15.3 million.

Now, we can calculate the percentage by dividing the deferred fuel costs by the total fuel write-offs and multiplying by 100.

percentage = (deferred fuel costs / total fuel write-offs) * 100

Substituting the given values:

percentage = ($8.9 million / $15.3 million) * 100

percentage = 0.5819 * 100

percentage = 58.19%

Therefore, the deferred fuel costs as a percentage of the total fuel write-offs in 2002 are 58.19%.

the volume/weather variance was due to higher electric sales volume in the service territory .
billed usage increased a total of 517 gwh in the residential and commercial sectors .
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in industrial usage of 470 gwh due to the loss of two large industrial customers to cogeneration .
the customers accounted for approximately 1% ( 1 % ) of entergy gulf states' net revenue in 2002 .
in 2002 , deferred fuel costs of $ 8.9 million related to a texas fuel reconciliation case were written off and $ 6.5 million in expense resulted from an adjustment in the deregulated asset plan percentage as the result of a power uprate at river bend .
the increase in net wholesale revenue was primarily due to an increase in sales volume to municipal and co- op customers and also to affiliated systems related to entergy's generation resource planning .
the base rate decreases were effective june 2002 and january 2003 , both in the louisiana jurisdiction .
the january 2003 base rate decrease of $ 22.1 million had a minimal impact on net income due to a corresponding reduction in nuclear depreciation and decommissioning expenses associated with the change in accounting to reflect an assumed extension of river bend's useful life .
in 2002 , a gain of $ 15.2 million was recognized for the louisiana portion of the 1988 nelson units 1 and 2 sale .
entergy gulf states received approval from the lpsc to discontinue applying amortization of the gain against recoverable fuel , resulting in the recognition of the deferred gain in income .
rate refund provisions caused a decrease in net revenue due to additional provisions recorded in 2003 compared to 2002 for potential rate actions and refunds .
gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses gross operating revenues increased primarily due to an increase of $ 440.2 million in fuel cost recovery revenues as a result of higher fuel rates in both the louisiana and texas jurisdictions .
fuel and purchased power expenses increased $ 471.1 million due to an increase in the market prices of natural gas and purchased power .
other income statement variances 2004 compared to 2003 other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to : 2022 voluntary severance program accruals of $ 22.5 million in 2003 ; and 2022 a decrease of $ 4.3 million in nuclear material and labor costs due to reduced staff in 2004. .

97,"considering the years 2021-2025 , what is the difference between the average projected benefit payments for the u.s . and international?","117.12","<REASONING>
To find the difference between the average projected benefit payments for the U.S. and international, we need to calculate the average for each and then subtract the international average from the U.S. average.

First, let's calculate the average projected benefit payments for the U.S.:

The projected benefit payments for the U.S. from 2021 to 2025 are $917.9. To find the average, we divide this by the number of years, which is 5.

average_us = total_us / number_of_years
average_us = 917.9 / 5
average_us = 183.58

Next, let's calculate the average projected benefit payments for international:

The projected benefit payments for international from 2021 to 2025 are $332.3. To find the average, we divide this by the number of years, which is 5.

average_international = total_international / number_of_years
average_international = 332.3 / 5
average_international = 66.46

Now, let's find the difference between the average projected benefit payments for the U.S. and international:

difference = average_us - average_international
difference = 183.58 - 66.46
difference = 117.12

Therefore, the difference between the average projected benefit payments for the U.S. and international from 2021 to 2025 is $117.12.

98,"as december 2004 what was the percent of the company 2019s total pension and postretirement plans that was due in 2007","0.963%","<REASONING>
To find the percentage of the company's 2019 total pension and postretirement plans that was due in 2007, we need to look at the table provided in the context, which sets forth amounts of benefits expected to be paid over the next ten years from the company's pension and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2004.

From the table, we can see that the amount of benefits expected to be paid in 2007 for pension benefits is $143, and for other postretirement benefits is $31.

To find the total amount of benefits expected to be paid in 2007, we add these two amounts together: $143 + $31 = $174.

To find the percentage of the company's 2019 total pension and postretirement plans that was due in 2007, we need to divide the total amount of benefits expected to be paid in 2007 by the total amount of benefits expected to be paid over the next ten years, and then multiply by 100.

The total amount of benefits expected to be paid over the next ten years is $17,724 for pension benefits and $352 for other postretirement benefits, for a total of $18,076.

So, the percentage of the company's 2019 total pension and postretirement plans that was due in 2007 is ($174 / $18,076) * 100.

Calculating this, we get: ($174 / $18,076) * 100 = 0.963% * 100 = 0.963 * 100 = 0.963.

Therefore, the percentage of the company's 2019 total pension and postretirement plans that was due in 2007 is 0.963%.

We need to calculate the percentage change for the global, North American, and European markets separately and then find the total percentage change.

For the global market:
old_value = 327000 (2007)
new_value = 412000 (2011)

percentage_change_global = ((412000 - 327000) / 327000) * 100
percentage_change_global = (85000 / 327000) * 100
percentage_change_global = 0.2597 * 100
percentage_change_global = 25.97%

For the North American market:
old_value = 212000 (2007)
new_value = 245000 (2011)

percentage_change_north_america = ((245000 - 212000) / 212000) * 100
percentage_change_north_america = (33000 / 212000) * 100
percentage_change_north_america = 0.1557 * 100
percentage_change_north_america = 15.57%

For the European market:
old_value = 105000 (2007)
new_value = 149000 (2011)

percentage_change_europe = ((149000 - 105000) / 105000) * 100
percentage_change_europe = (44000 / 105000) * 100
percentage_change_europe = 0.419 * 100
percentage_change_europe = 41.9%

To find the total percentage change, we need to find the weighted average of the percentage changes for the three markets. The weights are the number of berths in each market as a percentage of the total number of berths.

Weight for global market = (327000 / (327000 + 212000 + 105000)) = 0.500
Weight for North American market = (212000 / (327000 + 212000 + 105000)) = 0.289
Weight for European market = (105000 / (327000 + 212000 + 105000)) = 0.211

Total percentage change = (0.500 * 25.97%) + (0.289 * 15.57%) + (0.211 * 41.9%)
Total percentage change = 12.985% + 4.498% + 8.839%
Total percentage change = 26.322%

Therefore, the total percentage increase from 2007 to 2011 in the number of berths is 26.32%.

europe in europe , cruising represents a smaller but growing sector of the vacation industry .
it has experienced a compound annual growth rate in cruise guests of approximately 9.6% ( 9.6 % ) from 2007 to 2011 and we believe this market has significant continued growth poten- tial .
we estimate that europe was served by 104 ships with approximately 100000 berths at the beginning of 2007 and by 121 ships with approximately 155000 berths at the end of 2011 .
there are approximately 10 ships with an estimated 28000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the european cruise market between 2012 and 2016 .

( 1 ) source : our estimates of the number of global cruise guests , and the weighted-average supply of berths marketed globally , in north america and europe are based on a combination of data that we obtain from various publicly available cruise industry trade information sources including seatrade insider and cruise line international association .
in addition , our estimates incorporate our own statistical analysis utilizing the same publicly available cruise industry data as a base .
( 2 ) source : cruise line international association based on cruise guests carried for at least two consecutive nights for years 2007 through 2010 .
year 2011 amounts represent our estimates ( see number 1 above ) .
( 3 ) source : european cruise council for years 2007 through 2010 .
year 2011 amounts represent our estimates ( see number 1 above ) .
other markets in addition to expected industry growth in north america and europe as discussed above , we expect the asia/pacific region to demonstrate an even higher growth rate in the near term , although it will continue to represent a relatively small sector compared to north america and europe .
we compete with a number of cruise lines ; however , our principal competitors are carnival corporation & plc , which owns , among others , aida cruises , carnival cruise lines , costa cruises , cunard line , holland america line , iberocruceros , p&o cruises and princess cruises ; disney cruise line ; msc cruises ; norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises .
cruise lines compete with other vacation alternatives such as land-based resort hotels and sightseeing destinations for consum- ers 2019 leisure time .
demand for such activities is influ- enced by political and general economic conditions .
companies within the vacation market are dependent on consumer discretionary spending .
operating strategies our principal operating strategies are to : and employees and protect the environment in which our vessels and organization operate , to better serve our global guest base and grow our business , order to enhance our revenues while continuing to expand and diversify our guest mix through interna- tional guest sourcing , and ensure adequate cash and liquidity , with the overall goal of maximizing our return on invested capital and long-term shareholder value , our brands throughout the world , revitalization of existing ships and the transfer of key innovations across each brand , while expanding our fleet with the new state-of-the-art cruise ships recently delivered and on order , by deploying them into those markets and itineraries that provide opportunities to optimize returns , while continuing our focus on existing key markets , support ongoing operations and initiatives , and the principal industry distribution channel , while enhancing our consumer outreach programs. .

100,"what was the reduction in average price per share for repurchases from the period november 1 2013 30 to december 1 2013 31?","9","<REASONING>
To calculate the reduction in average price per share for repurchases from November 1, 2013, to December 1, 2013, we can use the formula:

reduction = (old_average_price - new_average_price)

We can find the old average price by dividing the total shares purchased from October 1, 2013, to November 1, 2013, by the total shares purchased during that period.

old_total_shares_purchased = 1204 + 1491 = 2695
old_average_price = 128.43

We can find the new average price by dividing the total shares purchased from November 1, 2013, to December 1, 2013, by the total shares purchased during that period.

new_total_shares_purchased = 1491 + 3458 = 4949
new_average_price = 119.43

Now, we can calculate the reduction in average price per share.

reduction = (old_average_price - new_average_price)
reduction = (128.43 - 119.43)
reduction = 9

Therefore, the reduction in average price per share for repurchases from November 1, 2013, to December 1, 2013, is 9 dollars.

To find the total amount spent on purchased shares in October 2018, we can refer to the table provided in the context. The table shows the total shares purchased, average price paid per share, and other details for the fourth quarter of 2018.

From the table, we can see that for the month of October 2018, the total shares purchased were 1204, and the average price paid per share was $128.43.

To find the total amount spent on purchased shares, we can multiply the total shares purchased by the average price paid per share.

total_amount_spent = total_shares_purchased * average_price_per_share
total_amount_spent = 1204 * $128.43
total_amount_spent = $154,611.72

Therefore, the total amount spent on purchased shares in October 2018 was $154,611.72.

            <CONTEXT>
            In 2008, the net cash from operating activities was $200,000.

            <REASONING>
                To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

                percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = (58620 / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = 0.2931 * 100

                percentage_change = 29.31%

                Therefore, the percentage change in the net cash from operating activities from 2008 to 2009 is 29.31%.

To calculate the percentage change in the fair value per share between 2012 and 2013, we can use the formula:

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = $23.93 (fair value per share in 2012)
new_value = $19.47 (fair value per share in 2013)

percentage_change = ((19.47 - 23.93) / 23.93) * 100

percentage_change = (-4.46 / 23.93) * 100

percentage_change = -0.1857 * 100

To calculate the percentage change in net revenue from 2015 to 2016, we can use the formula:

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 5829
new_value = 6179

percentage_change = ((6179 - 5829) / 5829) * 100

percentage_change = (350 / 5829) * 100

percentage_change = 0.06 * 100

percentage_change = 6%

                To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

                percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = (58620 / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = 0.2931 * 100

                percentage_change = 29.31%

                Therefore, the percentage change in the net cash from operating activities from 2008 to 2009 is 29.31%.

104,"what was the average effective income tax rate on continuing operations?","67.5%","<REASONING>
To calculate the average effective income tax rate on continuing operations, we need to find the average of the effective income tax rates for 2012 and 2011. 

The effective income tax rate on continuing operations for 2012 is 74% and for 2011 is 61%. 

To find the average, we can use the formula:

average = (value1 + value2) / 2

Substituting the given values:

value1 = 74
value2 = 61

average = (74 + 61) / 2

average = 135 / 2

average = 67.5

Therefore, the average effective income tax rate on continuing operations is 67.5%.

105,"what was the average decrease in the tax position from 2011 to 2013","-48,995","<REASONING>
To calculate the average decrease in the tax position from 2011 to 2013, we need to find the total decrease in the tax position over the two years and then divide by the number of years.

From the table, we can see that the balance at January 1, 2011, was $23,788. The decreases in current period tax positions for 2011 and 2012 were -$37,340 and -$59,650, respectively.

First, let's calculate the total decrease in the tax position from 2011 to 2012:

Total decrease = Decrease in 2011 + Decrease in 2012
Total decrease = -$37,340 + (-$59,650)
Total decrease = -$97,990

Next, let's calculate the average decrease in the tax position from 2011 to 2012:

Average decrease = Total decrease / Number of years
Average decrease = -$97,990 / 2
Average decrease = -$48,995

Therefore, the average decrease in the tax position from 2011 to 2012 is -$48,995.

106,"what percentage of cash provided by operating activities were dividends paid in 2013?","19.5%","<REASONING>
To find the percentage of cash provided by operating activities that were dividends paid in 2013, we need to divide the amount of dividends paid by the amount of cash provided by operating activities and then multiply by 100.

From the provided context, we can see that the amount of cash provided by operating activities in 2013 was $6,823 million and the amount of dividends paid was $1,333 million.

percentage = (dividends paid / cash provided by operating activities) * 100

Substituting the given values:

percentage = ($1,333 million / $6,823 million) * 100

percentage = 0.195 * 100

percentage = 19.5%

Therefore, the percentage of cash provided by operating activities that were dividends paid in 2013 is 19.5%.

2014 outlook f0b7 safety 2013 operating a safe railroad benefits our employees , our customers , our shareholders , and the communities we serve .
we will continue using a multi-faceted approach to safety , utilizing technology , risk assessment , quality control , training and employee engagement , and targeted capital investments .
we will continue using and expanding the deployment of total safety culture and courage to care throughout our operations , which allows us to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety .
derailment prevention and the reduction of grade crossing incidents are also critical aspects of our safety programs .
we will continue our efforts to increase detection of rail defects ; improve or close crossings ; and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety through a combination of our own programs ( including risk assessment strategies ) , various industry programs and local community activities across our network .
f0b7 network operations 2013 we believe the railroad is capable of handling growing volumes while providing high levels of customer service .
our track structure is in excellent condition , and certain sections of our network have surplus line and terminal capacity .
we are in a solid resource position , with sufficient supplies of locomotives , freight cars and crews to support growth .
f0b7 fuel prices 2013 uncertainty about the economy makes projections of fuel prices difficult .
we again could see volatile fuel prices during the year , as they are sensitive to global and u.s .
domestic demand , refining capacity , geopolitical events , weather conditions and other factors .
to reduce the impact of fuel price on earnings , we will continue seeking cost recovery from our customers through our fuel surcharge programs and expanding our fuel conservation efforts .
f0b7 capital plan 2013 in 2014 , we plan to make total capital investments of approximately $ 3.9 billion , including expenditures for positive train control ( ptc ) , which may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments .
( see further discussion in this item 7 under liquidity and capital resources 2013 capital plan. ) f0b7 positive train control 2013 in response to a legislative mandate to implement ptc by the end of 2015 , we have invested $ 1.2 billion in capital expenditures and plan to spend an additional $ 450 million during 2014 on developing and deploying ptc .
we currently estimate that ptc , in accordance with implementing rules issued by the federal rail administration ( fra ) , will cost us approximately $ 2 billion by the end of the project .
this includes costs for installing the new system along our tracks , upgrading locomotives to work with the new system , and adding digital data communication equipment to integrate the various components of the system and achieve interoperability for the industry .
although it is unlikely that the rail industry will meet the current mandatory 2015 deadline ( as the fra indicated in its 2012 report to congress ) , we are making a good faith effort to do so and we are working closely with regulators as we implement this new technology. .

To calculate the average cash provided by operating activities from 2011 to 2013, we need to find the sum of the cash provided by operating activities for the three years and then divide by the number of years.

From the provided context, we can see that the cash provided by operating activities for the years 2011, 2012, and 2013 are $58,730, $6,161, and $68,230, respectively.

First, we will find the sum of the cash provided by operating activities for the three years:

sum = 58730 + 6161 + 68230 = 121,021

Next, we will divide the sum by the number of years (3) to find the average:

average = sum / 3
average = 121,021 / 3
average = 40,340.33

Therefore, the average cash provided by operating activities from 2011 to 2013 is $40,340.33.

2014 outlook f0b7 safety 2013 operating a safe railroad benefits our employees , our customers , our shareholders , and the communities we serve .
we will continue using a multi-faceted approach to safety , utilizing technology , risk assessment , quality control , training and employee engagement , and targeted capital investments .
we will continue using and expanding the deployment of total safety culture and courage to care throughout our operations , which allows us to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety .
derailment prevention and the reduction of grade crossing incidents are also critical aspects of our safety programs .
we will continue our efforts to increase detection of rail defects ; improve or close crossings ; and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety through a combination of our own programs ( including risk assessment strategies ) , various industry programs and local community activities across our network .
f0b7 network operations 2013 we believe the railroad is capable of handling growing volumes while providing high levels of customer service .
our track structure is in excellent condition , and certain sections of our network have surplus line and terminal capacity .
we are in a solid resource position , with sufficient supplies of locomotives , freight cars and crews to support growth .
f0b7 fuel prices 2013 uncertainty about the economy makes projections of fuel prices difficult .
we again could see volatile fuel prices during the year , as they are sensitive to global and u.s .
domestic demand , refining capacity , geopolitical events , weather conditions and other factors .
to reduce the impact of fuel price on earnings , we will continue seeking cost recovery from our customers through our fuel surcharge programs and expanding our fuel conservation efforts .
f0b7 capital plan 2013 in 2014 , we plan to make total capital investments of approximately $ 3.9 billion , including expenditures for positive train control ( ptc ) , which may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments .
( see further discussion in this item 7 under liquidity and capital resources 2013 capital plan. ) f0b7 positive train control 2013 in response to a legislative mandate to implement ptc by the end of 2015 , we have invested $ 1.2 billion in capital expenditures and plan to spend an additional $ 450 million during 2014 on developing and deploying ptc .
we currently estimate that ptc , in accordance with implementing rules issued by the federal rail administration ( fra ) , will cost us approximately $ 2 billion by the end of the project .
this includes costs for installing the new system along our tracks , upgrading locomotives to work with the new system , and adding digital data communication equipment to integrate the various components of the system and achieve interoperability for the industry .
although it is unlikely that the rail industry will meet the current mandatory 2015 deadline ( as the fra indicated in its 2012 report to congress ) , we are making a good faith effort to do so and we are working closely with regulators as we implement this new technology. .

108,"what is the growth rate in operating profit for aeronautics in 2013?","-5.13%","<REASONING>
To calculate the growth rate in operating profit for the aeronautics segment in 2013, we can use the formula:

growth_rate = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 16,99 (operating profit in 2012)
new_value = 16,12 (operating profit in 2013)

growth_rate = ((16,12 - 16,99) / 16,99) * 100

growth_rate = (-0,87 / 16,99) * 100

growth_rate = -5,13%

Therefore, the growth rate in operating profit for the aeronautics segment in 2013 is -5.13%.

2014 compared to 2013 aeronautics 2019 net sales for 2014 increased $ 797 million , or 6% ( 6 % ) , compared to 2013 .
the increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $ 790 million for f-35 production contracts due to increased volume and sustainment activities ; about $ 55 million for the f-16 program due to increased deliveries ( 17 aircraft delivered in 2014 compared to 13 delivered in 2013 ) partially offset by contract mix ; and approximately $ 45 million for the f-22 program due to increased risk retirements .
the increases were partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $ 55 million for the f-35 development contract due to decreased volume , partially offset by the absence in 2014 of the downward revision to the profit booking rate that occurred in 2013 ; and about $ 40 million for the c-130 program due to fewer deliveries ( 24 aircraft delivered in 2014 compared to 25 delivered in 2013 ) and decreased sustainment activities , partially offset by contract mix .
aeronautics 2019 operating profit for 2014 increased $ 37 million , or 2% ( 2 % ) , compared to 2013 .
the increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $ 85 million for the f-35 development contract due to the absence in 2014 of the downward revision to the profit booking rate that occurred in 2013 ; about $ 75 million for the f-22 program due to increased risk retirements ; approximately $ 50 million for the c-130 program due to increased risk retirements and contract mix , partially offset by fewer deliveries ; and about $ 25 million for the c-5 program due to the absence in 2014 of the downward revisions to the profit booking rate that occurred in 2013 .
the increases were partially offset by lower operating profit of approximately $ 130 million for the f-16 program due to decreased risk retirements , partially offset by increased deliveries ; and about $ 70 million for sustainment activities due to decreased risk retirements and volume .
operating profit was comparable for f-35 production contracts as higher volume was offset by lower risk retirements .
adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters , were approximately $ 105 million lower for 2014 compared to 2013 .
2013 compared to 2012 aeronautics 2019 net sales for 2013 decreased $ 830 million , or 6% ( 6 % ) , compared to 2012 .
the decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $ 530 million for the f-16 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries ( 13 aircraft delivered in 2013 compared to 37 delivered in 2012 ) partially offset by aircraft configuration mix ; about $ 385 million for the c-130 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries ( 25 aircraft delivered in 2013 compared to 34 in 2012 ) partially offset by increased sustainment activities ; approximately $ 255 million for the f-22 program , which includes about $ 205 million due to .

To calculate the percentage change in non-cash stock-based compensation expense from 2012 to 2013, we can use the formula:

percentage_ change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = $167 million (non-cash stock-based compensation expense in 2012)
new_value = $189 million (non-cash stock-based compensation expense in 2013)

percentage_ change = ((189 - 167) / 167) * 100

percentage_ change = (22 / 167) * 100

percentage_ change = 0.1317 * 100

percentage_ change = 13.17%

Therefore, the percentage change in non-cash stock-based compensation expense from 2012 to 2013 is 13.17%.

in addition , our income tax liabilities for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were reduced by $ 215 million , $ 158 million , $ 96 million due to recognized tax benefits on stock-based compensation arrangements .
stock-based compensation plans under plans approved by our stockholders , we are authorized to grant key employees stock-based incentive awards , including options to purchase common stock , stock appreciation rights , restricted stock units ( rsus ) , performance stock units ( psus ) or other stock units .
the exercise price of options to purchase common stock may not be less than the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant .
no award of stock options may become fully vested prior to the third anniversary of the grant and no portion of a stock option grant may become vested in less than one year .
the minimum vesting period for restricted stock or stock units payable in stock is three years .
award agreements may provide for shorter or pro-rated vesting periods or vesting following termination of employment in the case of death , disability , divestiture , retirement , change of control or layoff .
the maximum term of a stock option or any other award is 10 years .
at december 31 , 2014 , inclusive of the shares reserved for outstanding stock options , rsus and psus , we had 19 million shares reserved for issuance under the plans .

rsus are valued based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant .
employees who are granted rsus receive the right to receive shares of stock after completion of the vesting period ; however , the shares are not issued and the employees cannot sell or transfer shares prior to vesting and have no voting rights until the rsus vest , generally three years from the date of the award .
employees who are granted rsus receive dividend-equivalent cash payments only upon vesting .
for these rsu awards , the grant-date fair value is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant less a discount to reflect the delay in payment of dividend-equivalent cash payments .
we recognize the grant-date fair value of rsus , less estimated forfeitures , as compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period , which beginning with the rsus granted in 2013 is shorter than the vesting period if the employee is retirement eligible on the date of grant or will become retirement eligible before the end of the vesting period. .

rsus are valued based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant .
employees who are granted rsus receive the right to receive shares of stock after completion of the vesting period ; however , the shares are not issued and the employees cannot sell or transfer shares prior to vesting and have no voting rights until the rsus vest , generally three years from the date of the award .
employees who are granted rsus receive dividend-equivalent cash payments only upon vesting .
for these rsu awards , the grant-date fair value is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant less a discount to reflect the delay in payment of dividend-equivalent cash payments .
we recognize the grant-date fair value of rsus , less estimated forfeitures , as compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period , which beginning with the rsus granted in 2013 is shorter than the vesting period if the employee is retirement eligible on the date of grant or will become retirement eligible before the end of the vesting period. .

110,"what is the percentage change in interest expense from 2005 to 2006?","15.48%","<REASONING>
To calculate the percentage change in interest expense from 2005 to 2006, we can use the formula:

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 116.4 (interest expense in 2005)
new_value = 134.4 (interest expense in 2006)

percentage_change = ((134.4 - 116.4) / 116.4) * 100

percentage_change = (18 / 116.4) * 100

percentage_change = 0.1548 * 100

percentage_change = 15.48%

Therefore, the percentage change in interest expense from 2005 to 2006 is 15.48%.

To calculate the average balance of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we can use the formula:

average_balance = (balance_2007 + balance_2006) / 2

Substituting the given values:

balance_2007 = $41 million
balance_2006 = $52.4 million

average_balance = ($41 million + $52.4 million) / 2

average_balance = $93.4 million / 2

average_balance = $46.7 million

Therefore, the average balance of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 is $46.7 million.

112,"what percentage of remaining securities are available for issuance under the 2009 non-management directors 2019 stock incentive plan .","1.555%","<REASONING>
To find the percentage of remaining securities available for issuance under the 2009 non-management directors' 2019 stock incentive plan, we need to extract the relevant information from the provided context. 

From the context, we can see that under the ""equity compensation plans approved by security holders"" category, there are 37,885,02 shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2009 performance incentive plan, 136,60,306 shares of common stock available for issuance under the employee stock purchase plan (2006), and 813,491 shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2009 non-management directors' 2019 stock incentive plan.

We are interested in the 2009 non-management directors' 2019 stock incentive plan, so we will focus on the last mentioned number, which is 813,491 shares.

The total number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans (excluding securities reflected in column a) is 52,359,299.

To find the percentage of remaining securities available for issuance under the 2009 non-management directors' 2019 stock incentive plan, we can use the formula:

percentage = (part/whole) * 100

Substituting the given values:

part = 813,491
whole = 52,359,299

percentage = (813,491 / 52,359,299) * 100

percentage = 0.01555 * 100

percentage = 1.555%

Therefore, the percentage of remaining securities available for issuance under the 2009 non-management directors' 2019 stock incentive plan is 1.555%.

113,"what was the ratio of the rent expense for operating leases with terms exceeding one month in 2008 to 2007","1.085","<REASONING>
To find the ratio of the rent expense for operating leases with terms exceeding one month in 2008 to 2007, we need to look at the provided context for the rent expense values for both years.

In the context, it is mentioned that the rent expense for operating leases with terms exceeding one month was $747 million in 2008 and $810 million in 2007.

To calculate the ratio, we can use the formula:

ratio = old_value / new_value

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 810,000,000
new_value = 747,000,000

ratio = 810,000,000 / 747,000,000

ratio = 1.085

Therefore, the ratio of the rent expense for operating leases with terms exceeding one month in 2008 to 2007 is 1.085.

114,"as of december 312008 what was the percent of the future minimum lease payments for operating and capital leases that was due in 2009","14.35%","<REASONING>
To calculate the percentage of the future minimum lease payments for operating and capital leases that was due in 2009, we need to find the total minimum lease payments due in 2009 and divide it by the total minimum lease payments for both operating and capital leases.

From the provided table, we can see that the total minimum lease payments for operating leases is $5909 million and for capital leases is $1898 million.

The total minimum lease payments due in 2009 for operating leases is $657 million and for capital leases is $188 million.

Therefore, the total minimum lease payments due in 2009 is $657 million + $188 million = $845 million.

The percentage of the future minimum lease payments for operating and capital leases that was due in 2009 is ($845 million / $5909 million + $1898 million) * 100.

To add the numbers in the denominator, we need to convert them to the same unit. We can convert $5909 million to $5899 million + $10 million, but since $10 million is negligible compared to $5909 million, we can ignore it for the purpose of this calculation.

So, the percentage is ($845 million / $5899 million) * 100.

To calculate this, we can first divide $845 million by $5899 million, which equals approximately 0.1435.

Then, we multiply 0.1435 by 100, which equals approximately 14.35%.

Therefore, the percentage of the future minimum lease payments for operating and capital leases that was due in 2009 is approximately 14.35%.

115,"in 2009 what was the percent of the capital leases of the total future minimum lease payments that were due in 2012","35.57%","<REASONING>
To find the percentage of the capital leases of the total future minimum lease payments that were due in 2012, we need to look at the table provided in the context. The table shows the future minimum lease payments under capital leases and non-cancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2009.

From the table, we can see that the total minimum lease payments due in 2012 for capital leases is $15,550. The total minimum lease payments due in 2012 for non-cancellable operating leases is $28,179.

To find the percentage of the capital leases of the total future minimum lease payments that were due in 2012, we can use the formula:

percentage = (capital leases / total lease payments) * 100

Substituting the given values:

capital leases = $15,550
total lease payments = $15,550 (capital leases) + $28,179 (non-cancellable operating leases) = $43,729

percentage = ($15,550 / $43,729) * 100

percentage = 0.3557 * 100

percentage = 35.57%

Therefore, the percentage of the capital leases of the total future minimum lease payments that were due in 2012 is 35.57%.

notes to consolidated financial statements of annual compensation was made .
for the years ended december 31 , 2009 , 2008 and , 2007 , we made matching contributions of approxi- mately $ 450000 , $ 503000 and $ 457000 , respectively .
note 17 / commitments and contingencies we and our operating partnership are not presently involved in any mate- rial litigation nor , to our knowledge , is any material litigation threatened against us or our properties , other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business .
management believes the costs , if any , incurred by us and our operating partnership related to this litigation will not materially affect our financial position , operating results or liquidity .
we have entered into employment agreements with certain executives , which expire between june 2010 and january 2013 .
the minimum cash-based compensation , including base salary and guaran- teed bonus payments , associated with these employment agreements totals approximately $ 7.8 million for 2010 .
in march 1998 , we acquired an operating sub-leasehold posi- tion at 420 lexington avenue .
the operating sub-leasehold position required annual ground lease payments totaling $ 6.0 million and sub- leasehold position payments totaling $ 1.1 million ( excluding an operating sub-lease position purchased january 1999 ) .
in june 2007 , we renewed and extended the maturity date of the ground lease at 420 lexington avenue through december 31 , 2029 , with an option for further exten- sion through 2080 .
ground lease rent payments through 2029 will total approximately $ 10.9 million per year .
thereafter , the ground lease will be subject to a revaluation by the parties thereto .
in june 2009 , we acquired an operating sub-leasehold posi- tion at 420 lexington avenue for approximately $ 7.7 million .
these sub-leasehold positions were scheduled to mature in december 2029 .
in october 2009 , we acquired the remaining sub-leasehold position for $ 7.6 million .
the property located at 711 third avenue operates under an operating sub-lease , which expires in 2083 .
under the sub-lease , we are responsible for ground rent payments of $ 1.55 million annually through july 2011 on the 50% ( 50 % ) portion of the fee we do not own .
the ground rent is reset after july 2011 based on the estimated fair market value of the property .
we have an option to buy out the sub-lease at a fixed future date .
the property located at 461 fifth avenue operates under a ground lease ( approximately $ 2.1 million annually ) with a term expiration date of 2027 and with two options to renew for an additional 21 years each , followed by a third option for 15 years .
we also have an option to purchase the ground lease for a fixed price on a specific date .
the property located at 625 madison avenue operates under a ground lease ( approximately $ 4.6 million annually ) with a term expiration date of 2022 and with two options to renew for an additional 23 years .
the property located at 1185 avenue of the americas oper- ates under a ground lease ( approximately $ 8.5 million in 2010 and $ 6.9 million annually thereafter ) with a term expiration of 2020 and with an option to renew for an additional 23 years .
in april 1988 , the sl green predecessor entered into a lease agreement for the property at 673 first avenue , which has been capitalized for financial statement purposes .
land was estimated to be approximately 70% ( 70 % ) of the fair market value of the property .
the portion of the lease attributed to land is classified as an operating lease and the remainder as a capital lease .
the initial lease term is 49 years with an option for an additional 26 years .
beginning in lease years 11 and 25 , the lessor is entitled to additional rent as defined by the lease agreement .
we continue to lease the 673 first avenue property , which has been classified as a capital lease with a cost basis of $ 12.2 million and cumulative amortization of $ 5.5 million and $ 5.2 million at december 31 , 2009 and 2008 , respectively .
the following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments under capital leases and noncancellable operating leases with initial terms in excess of one year as of december 31 , 2009 ( in thousands ) : non-cancellable december 31 , capital lease operating leases .

note 18 / financial instruments : derivatives and hedging we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value .
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income .
if a derivative is a hedge , depending on the nature of the hedge , changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset , liability , or firm commitment through earn- ings , or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings .
the ineffective portion of a derivative 2019s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings .
reported net income and stockholders 2019 equity may increase or decrease prospectively , depending on future levels of interest rates and other variables affecting the fair values of derivative instruments and hedged items , but will have no effect on cash flows. .

116,"what is the total value of non-vested shares as of may 31 , 2009 , ( in millions ) ?","28.3 million","<REASONING>
To find the total value of non-vested shares as of May 31, 2009, we need to calculate the total value of unvested restricted stock awards and the total value of unvested shares from the employee stock purchase plan.

From the context, we can see that the total fair value of unvested restricted stock awards as of May 31, 2009, is $23.5 million.

The total value of unvested shares from the employee stock purchase plan can be calculated by multiplying the number of unvested shares by the weighted average grant-date fair value. As of May 31, 2009, there were 0.8 million shares issued under the plan, with 1.6 million shares reserved for future issuance. The weighted average grant-date fair value of each designated share purchased under this plan was $6 in 2009.

Therefore, the total value of unvested shares from the employee stock purchase plan as of May 31, 2009, is 0.8 million * $6 = $4.8 million.

The total value of non-vested shares as of May 31, 2009, is the sum of the total value of unvested restricted stock awards and the total value of unvested shares from the employee stock purchase plan, which is $23.5 million + $4.8 million = $28.3 million.

                To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

                Substituting the given values:

                old_value = 200000
                new_value = 258620

                percentage_change = ((258620 - 200000) / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = (58620 / 200000) * 100

                percentage_change = 0.2931 * 100

To calculate the average backlog at year-end of MFC from 2011 to 2013, we can use the formula:

average_backlog = (backlog_2011 + backlog_2012 + backlog_2013) / 3

Substituting the given values:

backlog_2011 = 14400
backlog_2012 = 14700
backlog_2013 = 15000

average_backlog = (14400 + 14700 + 15000) / 3

average_backlog = 44100 / 3

average_backlog = 14700

partially offsetting the decreases were higher net sales of approximately $ 140 million from qtc , which was acquired early in the fourth quarter of 2011 ; and about $ 65 million from increased activity on numerous other programs , primarily federal cyber security programs and ptds operational support .
is&gs 2019 operating profit for 2012 decreased $ 66 million , or 8% ( 8 % ) , compared to 2011 .
the decrease was attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $ 50 million due to the favorable impact of the odin contract completion in 2011 ; about $ 25 million due to an increase in reserves for performance issues related to an international airborne surveillance system in 2012 ; and approximately $ 20 million due to lower volume on certain programs ( primarily c2bmc and win-t ) .
partially offsetting the decreases was an increase in operating profit due to higher risk retirements of approximately $ 15 million from the twic program ; and about $ 10 million due to increased activity on numerous other programs , primarily federal cyber security programs and ptds operational support .
operating profit for the jtrs program was comparable as a decrease in volume was offset by a decrease in reserves .
adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above , were approximately $ 20 million higher for 2012 compared to 2011 .
backlog backlog decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower orders on several programs ( such as eram and ngi ) , higher sales on certain programs ( the national science foundation antarctic support and the disa gsm-o ) , and declining activities on several smaller programs primarily due to the continued downturn in federal information technology budgets .
backlog decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the substantial completion of various programs in 2011 ( primarily odin , u.k .
census , and jtrs ) .
trends we expect is&gs 2019 net sales to decline in 2014 in the high single digit percentage range as compared to 2013 primarily due to the continued downturn in federal information technology budgets .
operating profit is also expected to decline in 2014 in the high single digit percentage range consistent with the expected decline in net sales , resulting in margins that are comparable with 2013 results .

2013 compared to 2012 mfc 2019s net sales for 2013 increased $ 300 million , or 4% ( 4 % ) , compared to 2012 .
the increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $ 450 million for air and missile defense programs ( thaad and pac-3 ) due to increased production volume and deliveries ; about $ 70 million for fire control programs due to net increased deliveries and volume ; and approximately $ 55 million for tactical missile programs due to net increased deliveries .
the increases were partially offset by lower net sales of about $ 275 million for various technical services programs due to lower volume driven by the continuing impact of defense budget reductions and related competitive pressures .
the increase for fire control programs was primarily attributable to increased deliveries on the sniper ae and lantirn ae programs , increased volume on the sof clss program , partially offset by lower volume on longbow fire control radar and other programs .
the increase for tactical missile programs was primarily attributable to increased deliveries on jassm and other programs , partially offset by fewer deliveries on the guided multiple launch rocket system and javelin programs. .

118,"what is the return on investment for s&p500 if the investment is sold at the end of year 2014?","27%","<REASONING>
To calculate the return on investment (ROI) for the S&P 500 if the investment is sold at the end of year 2014, we need to find the percentage change in the value of the S&P 500 from the initial investment date (May 9, 2013) to the end of 2014.

From the provided table, we can see that the initial value of the S&P 500 on May 9, 2013, is $100. The value of the S&P 500 at the end of 2014 is $127.

To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 100
new_value = 127

percentage_change = ((127 - 100) / 100) * 100

percentage_change = (27 / 100) * 100

percentage_change = 0.27 * 100

percentage_change = 27%

Therefore, the percentage change in the value of the S&P 500 from May 9, 2013, to the end of 2014 is 27%.

To find the ROI, we need to know the initial investment amount. Since the table assumes that $100 was invested in the S&P 500 as of the close of market on May 9, 2013, we can use this as the initial investment amount.

ROI = (final_value - initial_value) / initial_value * 100

Substituting the given values:

initial_value = 100
final_value = 127

ROI = (127 - 100) / 100 * 100

ROI = 27 / 100 * 100

ROI = 27%

Therefore, the return on investment for the S&P 500 if the investment is sold at the end of year 2014 is 27%.

To calculate the return on investment (ROI) for Q if the investment is sold at the end of year 2014, we need to find the change in value of the investment from the initial investment to the end of 2014 and then divide it by the initial investment.

From the provided table, we can see that the initial investment in Q was $100 on May 9, 2013, and the value at the end of 2014 was $140.

The change in value is calculated as follows:

Change in value = Value at the end of 2014 - Initial investment
Change in value = $140 - $100
Change in value = $40

Now, we can calculate the ROI using the formula:

ROI = (Change in value / Initial investment) * 100
ROI = ($40 / $100) * 100
ROI = 0.4 * 100
ROI = 40%

Therefore, the return on investment for Q if the investment is sold at the end of year 2014 is 40%.

120,"what is the net change in net revenue during 2016?","1244","<REASONING>
To calculate the net change in net revenue during 2016, we can use the given table data. The table provides the net revenue for 2015 and 2016, as well as the various components that affect the net revenue.

From the table, we can see that the net revenue for 2015 was $16,666 million and the net revenue for 2016 was $15,422 million.

To find the net change in net revenue, we can subtract the net revenue for 2016 from the net revenue for 2015:

net_change = 2015_net_revenue - 2016_net_revenue
net_change = 16666 - 15422
net_change = 1244

Therefore, the net change in net revenue during 2016 is $1,244 million.

as shown in the table above , net revenue for entergy wholesale commodities decreased by approximately $ 124 million in 2016 primarily due to : 2022 lower realized wholesale energy prices and lower capacity prices , although the average revenue per mwh shown in the table below for the nuclear fleet is slightly higher because it includes revenues from the fitzpatrick reimbursement agreement with exelon , the amortization of the palisades below-market ppa , and vermont yankee capacity revenue .
the effect of the amortization of the palisades below-market ppa and vermont yankee capacity revenue on the net revenue variance from 2015 to 2016 is minimal ; 2022 the sale of the rhode island state energy center in december 2015 .
see note 14 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rhode island state energy center sale ; and 2022 lower volume in the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear fleet resulting from more refueling outage days in 2016 as compared to 2015 and larger exercise of resupply options in 2016 as compared to 2015 .

To calculate the growth rate in net revenue in 2016, we can use the formula:

growth_rate = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values from the table:

old_value = 5829
new_value = 6179

growth_rate = ((6179 - 5829) / 5829) * 100

growth_rate = (350 / 5829) * 100

122,"what is the percentage change in the net debt-to-net capital excluding securitization bonds from 2016 to 2017?","5.51%","<REASONING>
To calculate the percentage change in the net debt-to-net capital excluding securitization bonds from 2016 to 2017, we can use the formula:

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values from the table:

old_value = 61.8%
new_value = 65.2%

percentage_change = ((65.2 - 61.8) / 61.8) * 100

percentage_change = (3.4 / 61.8) * 100

percentage_change = 0.0551 * 100

percentage_change = 5.51%

Therefore, the percentage change in the net debt-to-net capital excluding securitization bonds from 2016 to 2017 is 5.51%.

operations may be extended up to four additional years for each unit by mutual agreement of entergy and new york state based on an exigent reliability need for indian point generation .
in accordance with the ferc-approved tariff of the new york independent system operator ( nyiso ) , entergy submitted to the nyiso a notice of generator deactivation based on the dates in the settlement ( no later than april 30 , 2020 for indian point unit 2 and april 30 , 2021 for indian point unit 3 ) .
in december 2017 , nyiso issued a report stating there will not be a system reliability need following the deactivation of indian point .
the nyiso also has advised that it will perform an analysis of the potential competitive impacts of the proposed retirement under provisions of its tariff .
the deadline for the nyiso to make a withholding determination is in dispute and is pending before the ferc .
in addition to contractually agreeing to cease commercial operations early , in february 2017 entergy filed with the nrc an amendment to its license renewal application changing the term of the requested licenses to coincide with the latest possible extension by mutual agreement based on exigent reliability needs : april 30 , 2024 for indian point 2 and april 30 , 2025 for indian point 3 .
if entergy reasonably determines that the nrc will treat the amendment other than as a routine amendment , entergy may withdraw the amendment .
other provisions of the settlement include termination of all then-existing investigations of indian point by the agencies signing the agreement , which include the new york state department of environmental conservation , the new york state department of state , the new york state department of public service , the new york state department of health , and the new york state attorney general .
the settlement recognizes the right of new york state agencies to pursue new investigations and enforcement actions with respect to new circumstances or existing conditions that become materially exacerbated .
another provision of the settlement obligates entergy to establish a $ 15 million fund for environmental projects and community support .
apportionment and allocation of funds to beneficiaries are to be determined by mutual agreement of new york state and entergy .
the settlement recognizes new york state 2019s right to perform an annual inspection of indian point , with scope and timing to be determined by mutual agreement .
in may 2017 a plaintiff filed two parallel state court appeals challenging new york state 2019s actions in signing and implementing the indian point settlement with entergy on the basis that the state failed to perform sufficient environmental analysis of its actions .
all signatories to the settlement agreement , including the entergy affiliates that hold nrc licenses for indian point , were named .
the appeals were voluntarily dismissed in november 2017 .
