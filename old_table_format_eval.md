To calculate the percentage gain on the sale of the starter brand business, we need to find the gain on the sale of the business and then calculate the percentage gain relative to the initial investment. However, the provided context does not explicitly state the initial investment for the starter brand business. The context mentions the sale of the homecare business, which had a gain of $207.4 million and an initial investment of $590 million. However, it does not provide information on the starter brand business.

Therefore, without the initial investment for the starter brand business, we cannot calculate the percentage gain on its sale.

To find the increase in billions of dollars in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries from September 27, 2008 to September 29, 2007 is not possible as the provided context does not contain the necessary information for the specified date range. However, we can find the increase from September 24, 2011 to September 30, 2019.

As of September 24, 2011, the company had $54.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2019, the company had approximately $129.8 million of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries. However, the context also mentions that "primarily all of the cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2019 were held outside of the u.s. and at september 30, 2019, total debt was $10063.4 million, $561.1 million of which was current."

To find the increase in billions of dollars, we need to subtract the amount held by foreign subsidiaries in 2019 from the amount held by foreign subsidiaries in 2011. However, the provided context does not contain the necessary information to calculate the increase in billions of dollars in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries from September 24, 2011 to September 30, 2019.

However, we can calculate the decrease in billions of dollars in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries from September 24, 2011 to September 30, 2019. As of September 24, 2011, the company had $54.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2019, the company had approximately $129.8 million of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries. The decrease is $53.9 billion ($54.3 billion - $129.8 million).

However, the question asks for the increase in billions of dollars in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries from September 27, 2008 to September 29, 2007. The provided context does not contain the necessary information for the specified date range.

To calculate the increase in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments from 2007 to 2008, we can use the given table data.

From the table, we can see that the net change in cash and cash equivalents for the years 2007, 2008, and 2009 are $51 million, $371 million, and $601 million, respectively.

To find the increase from 2007 to 2008, we can subtract the net change in cash and cash equivalents for 2007 from the net change in cash and cash equivalents for 2008.

Increase = Net change in cash and cash equivalents for 2008 - Net change in cash and cash equivalents for 2007
Increase = $371 million - $51 million
Increase = $320 million

Therefore, the increase in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments from 2007 to 2008 is $320 million.

To calculate the percentage change in nonrecurring losses from 2012 to 2013, we need to first identify the nonrecurring losses for both years. 

From the provided context, we can see that the net loss in 2012 was $2.0 billion, and the net income in 2011 was $919 million. However, we cannot directly determine the nonrecurring losses from this information.

We also see that the private equity reported net income of $292 million in 2012, compared with net income of $391 million in the prior year. The net revenue was $601 million, compared with $836 million in the prior year, due to lower unrealized and realized gains on private investments, partially offset by higher unrealized gains on public securities. Noninterest expense was $145 million, down from $238 million in the prior year.

Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $2.1 billion in 2012, compared with net income of $1.3 billion in the prior year. The current year loss reflected $5.8 billion of losses incurred by CIO from the synthetic credit portfolio for the six months ended June 30, 2012, and $449 million of losses from the retained index credit derivative positions for the three months ended September 30, 2012. These losses were partially offset by securities gains of $2.0 billion.

Other corporate reported a net loss of $221 million, compared with a net loss of $821 million in the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $1.8 billion was driven by a $1.1 billion benefit for the Washington Mutual bankruptcy settlement, which is included in all other income in the above table, and a $665 million gain from the recovery on a Bear Stearns-related subordinated loan. Noninterest expense of $3.8 billion was up $1.0 billion compared with the prior year. The current year included expense of $3.7 billion for additional litigation reserves, largely for mortgage-related matters.

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state the nonrecurring losses for 2012 and 2013. Therefore, we cannot calculate the percentage change in nonrecurring losses from 2012 to 2013.

To calculate the average decrease in the tax position from 2011 to 2013, we need to find the difference in the unrecognized tax benefits between 2011 and 2013, and then divide it by the number of years.

From the context, we can see that the beginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits in 2011 was $20,807 million and in 2012 was $18,868 million. However, the context does not provide the beginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits in 2013. We can infer that the beginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits in 2013 is the ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits in 2012, which is $18,868 million.

The ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits in 2013 is $22,370 million.

The change in unrecognized tax benefits from 2011 to 2013 is the difference between the ending balance in 2013 and the beginning balance in 2011, which is $22,370 million - $20,807 million = $1,563 million.

To find the average decrease, we divide the change in unrecognized tax benefits by the number of years, which is 2 (2012 and 2013). However, the context does not provide the beginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits in 2012, but it does provide the ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits in 2012, which is $18,868 million. Therefore, we can calculate the average decrease as follows:

Average decrease = (Ending balance in 2013 - Beginning balance in 2011) / 2
Average decrease = ($22,370 million - $20,807 million) / 2
Average decrease = $1,563 million / 2
Average decrease = $781.5 million

Therefore, the average decrease in the tax position from 2011 to 2013 is $781.5 million.

To find the company's net valuation allowance at the end of 2013, we need to look at the provided table summarizing the changes in the company's valuation allowance. The table shows the balance at January 1, 2011, and the changes in the current period tax positions and decreases in the current period tax positions for each year up to December 31, 2013.

From the table, we can see that the balance at January 1, 2011, is $23,788. The increases in current period tax positions for 2011 are $15,325, and the decreases in current period tax positions for 2011 are $37,340. The balance at December 31, 2011, is $21,579.

Similarly, for 2012, the balance at December 31, 2012, is $19,520. For 2013, the balance at December 31, 2013, is $13,555.

However, the table also mentions a discrete tax benefit totaling $29,779 associated with an entity re-organization within the company's market-based segment that allowed for the utilization of state net operating loss carryforwards and the release of an associated valuation allowance. This means that the net valuation allowance at the end of 2013 is not just the balance at December 31, 2013, but also includes the discrete tax benefit.

Therefore, the company's net valuation allowance at the end of 2013 is $13,555 + $29,779 = $43,334.

To calculate the growth rate in net sales for IS&GS in 2011, we can use the formula:

growth_rate = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 9381 (net sales for IS&GS in 2010)
new_value = 9341 (net sales for IS&GS in 2011)

growth_rate = ((9341 - 9381) / 9381) * 100

growth_rate = (-40 / 9381) * 100

growth_rate = -0.427 * 100

growth_rate = -42.7%

Therefore, the growth rate in net sales for IS&GS in 2011 is -42.7%.

To calculate the percentage of the total assets acquired allocated to undeveloped land, we need to find the total amount allocated to undeveloped land and divide it by the total assets acquired.

From the context, we can see that the total assets acquired were $86,755,800,000. The amount allocated to undeveloped land and the container storage facility was $20,000,000.

percentage_of_undeveloped_land = (amount_allocated_to_undeveloped_land / total_assets_acquired) * 100

Substituting the given values:

amount_allocated_to_undeveloped_land = 20,000,000
total_assets_acquired = 86,755,800,000

percentage_of_undeveloped_land = (20,000,000 / 86,755,800,000) * 100

percentage_of_undeveloped_land = 0.0231 * 100

To calculate the percentage of contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations that are short-term for the year 2014, we need to first identify the total contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at December 31, 2012, and then determine how much of that amount is due within one year (i.e., short-term).

From the provided context, we can see that there is no direct information about the total contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at December 31, 2012. However, we can infer that the build-to-suit lease in August 2012 and the promissory note entered into in 2014 are part of the contractual obligations.

The build-to-suit lease has a lease term of 120 months and commenced in August 2013. As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases consist of the following: $6,306,000 for 2016, $66,780,000 for 2017, $62,600,000 for 2018, $5,809,000 for 2019, $55,800,000 for 2020, and $21,450,000 for thereafter.

The promissory note has an interest rate of 8.0% per annum and is payable quarterly. All unpaid principal and accrued interest on the promissory note is due and payable on the earlier of August 26, 2017, or upon default.

Since the promissory note is due in 2017, it is a short-term obligation. The build-to-suit lease has future minimum payments due in 2016 and beyond, so it has both short-term and long-term obligations.

As of December 31, 2015, $1,300,000 and $41,200,000 were recorded as short-term and long-term financing obligations, respectively, under the build-to-suit lease. The promissory note is not included in these amounts.

To calculate the percentage of short-term contractual obligations, we need to add the short-term obligations under the build-to-suit lease and the promissory note. The total short-term obligations are $1,300,000 (build-to-suit lease) + $0 (promissory note, since it is due in 2017 and the context only provides information up to 2015) = $1,300,000.

However, we cannot calculate the percentage of short-term contractual obligations for the year 2014, as the provided context does not include information about the total contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at December 31, 2012.

Therefore, we cannot provide a numerical answer to the question.

To calculate the total amount spent purchasing common stock under the programs from 2016-2018, we need to sum up the total number of shares purchased and multiply it by the average price paid per share for each year.

For 2016, the total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs is 236,111 (from the table in the context). The average price paid per share is $62.95 (from the table in the context). Therefore, the total amount spent in 2016 is 236,111 * $62.95.

For 2017, there is no relevant data provided in the context about the total number of shares purchased and the average price paid per share.

For 2018, the total number of shares purchased is 12,508,023 (from the table in the context). The average price paid per share is $153.04 (from the table in the context). Therefore, the total amount spent in 2018 is 12,508,023 * $153.04.

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent purchasing common stock under the programs from 2016-2018:

Total amount spent in 2016 = 236,111 * $62.95 = $14,844,111.45
Total amount spent in 2018 = 12,508,023 * $153.04 = $1,923,111,062.72

Since there is no relevant data provided for 2017, we will not include it in the total amount spent.

Therefore, the total amount spent purchasing common stock under the programs from 2016-2018 is $14,844,111.45 + $1,923,111,062.72 = $1,923,265,174.17.

To convert this amount to billions, we divide by 1,000,000,000:

$1,923,265,174.17 / 1,000,000,000 = $1.923 billion

Therefore, the total amount spent purchasing common stock under the programs from 2016-2018 is approximately $1.923 billion.

To calculate the percentage change in rental expense for operating leases from 2008 to 2009, we need to first find the rental expense for operating leases in both years. However, the provided context does not directly state the rental expense for operating leases in 2008 and 2009. Instead, it provides a schedule of future minimum rental payments required under long-term operating leases at October 30, 2010, and notes to consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2007, which include future minimum rental payments required under operating leases for continuing operations that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year.

From the context, we can see that the total minimum payments required under operating leases for continuing operations that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows:

- 2008: $317 million
- 2009: $275 million

However, these values are for the minimum payments required, not the actual rental expense. The rental expense for operating leases is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

Therefore, we cannot calculate the percentage change in rental expense for operating leases from 2008 to 2009 based on the given information.

To calculate the percentage change in rental expense for operating leases from 2007 to 2008, we need to first find the rental expense for operating leases in both years. 

From the provided context, we can see that the rental expense for operating leases in 2007 is not explicitly stated. However, we can find the total minimum payments required under operating leases for continuing operations that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year, net of sublease rental income, for the year 2007. This is $18.30 million.

We also know that the rental expense for operating leases in 2008 is $9.3 million.

Since the total minimum payments required under operating leases for continuing operations that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year, net of sublease rental income, is not the same as the rental expense for operating leases, we cannot directly calculate the percentage change in rental expense for operating leases from 2007 to 2008 using the provided context.

However, we can calculate the percentage change in total minimum payments required under operating leases from 2007 to 2008. 

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 18.30
new_value = 17.8 (Note: The total minimum payments required under operating leases for 2008 is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, we can infer it from the table data provided for Aon Corporation, which states that the total minimum payments required under operating leases for 2008 is $317 million. But this is for Aon Corporation, not the company in question. Since we cannot find the total minimum payments required under operating leases for 2008 for the company in question, we will use the rental expense for operating leases in 2008, which is $9.3 million, as a proxy for the new value. However, this is not the correct value to use for the calculation. The correct value to use for the calculation is the total minimum payments required under operating leases for 2008, which is $317 million for Aon Corporation, not the company in question. Since we cannot find the total minimum payments required under operating leases for 2008 for the company in question, we cannot calculate the percentage change in total minimum payments required under operating leases from 2007 to 2008.)

Therefore, we cannot calculate the percentage change in rental expense for operating leases from 2007 to 2008 using the provided context.

To calculate the percentage of operating income that was the EMEA segment in 2016, we need to find the operating income of the EMEA segment and divide it by the total operating income.

From the provided context, we can find the operating income of the EMEA segment in 2016 as $11,420 thousand.

The total operating income in 2016 is $41,747 thousand.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of operating income that was the EMEA segment in 2016:

percentage = (operating income of EMEA segment / total operating income) * 100

percentage = ($11,420 / $41,747) * 100

percentage = 0.2739 * 100

percentage = 27.39%

Therefore, the percentage of operating income that was the EMEA segment in 2016 is 27.39%.

To find the total net operating loss carryforwards, we need to add the US federal net operating loss carryforwards, state operating loss carryforwards, and foreign operating and capital loss carryforwards.

From the context, we have the following information:

- US federal net operating loss carryforwards: $206 million
- State operating loss carryforwards: $610 million
- Foreign operating loss carryforwards: $720 million
- Foreign capital loss carryforwards: $251 million

Total net operating loss carryforwards = US federal net operating loss carryforwards + state operating loss carryforwards + foreign operating loss carryforwards + foreign capital loss carryforwards
Total net operating loss carryforwards = $206 million + $610 million + $720 million + $251 million
Total net operating loss carryforwards = $1787 million

Therefore, the total net operating loss carryforwards is $1787 million.

To calculate the percentage change in net reserves from 2011 to 2012, we need to find the net reserves for both years. However, the provided context does not contain information about the net reserves for the years 2011 and 2012. Therefore, we cannot calculate the percentage change in net reserves from 2011 to 2012 based on the given context.

However, we can find the net cash provided by operating activities for the years 2012, 2013, and 2014. The net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 was $357.2 million, in 2013 was $592.9 million, and in 2014 was $669.5 million.

If we assume that the net reserves are related to the net cash provided by operating activities, we can calculate the percentage change in net cash provided by operating activities from 2012 to 2013 and from 2013 to 2014.

The percentage change in net cash provided by operating activities from 2012 to 2013 can be calculated as follows:

percentage_change_2012_to_2013 = ((592.9 - 357.2) / 357.2) * 100
percentage_change_2012_to_2013 = (235.7 / 357.2) * 100
percentage_change_2012_to_2013 = 0.6604 * 100
percentage_change_2012_to_2013 = 66.04%

The percentage change in net cash provided by operating activities from 2013 to 2014 can be calculated as follows:

percentage_change_2013_to_2014 = ((669.5 - 592.9) / 592.9) * 100
percentage_change_2013_to_2014 = (76.6 / 592.9) * 100
percentage_change_2013_to_2014 = 0.1292 * 100
percentage_change_2013_to_2014 = 12.92%

Therefore, the percentage change in net cash provided by operating activities from 2012 to 2013 was 66.04%, and from 2013 to 2014 was 12.92%.

To calculate the percentage change in the research and development costs from 2015 to 2016, we need to find the research and development costs for both years. However, the provided context does not contain the specific research and development costs for 2015 and 2016. It contains information about the company's financial data for different years, but it does not directly provide the research and development costs for those years.

Therefore, we cannot calculate the percentage change in the research and development costs from 2015 to 2016 based on the given context.

To calculate the increase in total revenues from 2010 to 2011, we can use the given table data:

Table Data:
in millions	year ended december 2012	year ended december 2011	year ended december 20
e&p	$ 13029	$ 10,782	$ 9,657
osm	15,88	833	833
ig	93	150	150
segment revenues	14710	11765	11765
elimination of intersegment revenues	-47 ( 47 )	-75 ( 75 )	-75 ( 75 )
total revenues	$ 14,663	$ 11,690	$ 10,790

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 11690 (total revenues in 2010)
new_value = 14663 (total revenues in 2011)

increase = new_value - old_value
increase = 14663 - 11690
increase = 2973

Therefore, the total revenues increased by $2,973 million from 2010 to 2011.

To calculate the percentage change in the goodwill balance between the beginning of 2016 and the end of 2017, we can use the formula:

percentage_change = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 94417 (goodwill balance at December 31, 2016)
new_value = 93192 (goodwill balance at December 30, 2017)

percentage_change = ((93192 - 94417) / 94417) * 100

percentage_change = (-1265 / 94417) * 100

percentage_change = -0.0134 * 100

percentage_change = -1.34%

Therefore, the percentage change in the goodwill balance between the beginning of 2016 and the end of 2017 is -1.34%.

    The context provided does not contain any information about the growth in recurring tenant improvements from 2006 to 2007. It appears to be a collection of notes to consolidated financial statements from various companies, including Kimco Realty Corporation, SL Green Realty Corp, and Hologic Inc. These notes cover various topics such as leases, financial instruments, and derivatives, but do not provide any specific information about recurring tenant improvements.

    Therefore, I cannot calculate the percentage growth in recurring tenant improvements from 2006 to 2007 based on the provided context.

To calculate the percentage change in rental expenses from 2017 to 2018, we need to find the rental expenses for both years. 

From the provided context, we can find the rental expenses for 2017 and 2018 in the following documents:

- For 2017: Double_ECL/2017/page_96.pdf
- For 2018: Double_ECL/2017/page_96.pdf and Double_ANET/2017/page_156.pdf

In Double_ECL/2017/page_96.pdf, we find that the total rental expense under the company's operating leases was $239 million in 2017.

In Double_ANET/2017/page_156.pdf, we find the aggregate future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases for 2018, which is $9,127 thousand. To convert this to millions, we divide by 1000, resulting in $9.127 million. However, this is not the rental expense for 2018. The rental expense for 2018 is not explicitly stated in the provided context. 

Since we cannot find the rental expense for 2018 in the provided context, we cannot calculate the percentage change in rental expenses from 2017 to 2018.

To calculate the percentage of the total for all years that was due to contributions from the year 2020, we need to first find the total contributions for all years and then find the contribution for the year 2020. However, the provided context does not contain any information about contributions for the year 2020. Therefore, we cannot calculate the percentage.

Additionally, the context contains information about various types of benefits and expenses, such as pension plans, defined contribution savings plans, postretirement plans, and litigation settlements. However, it does not provide any information about contributions for the year 2020.

Therefore, we cannot provide a calculation for the percentage of the total for all years that was due to contributions from the year 2020.

To find the total pre-tax catastrophe losses in the last three years, we need to look at the provided context for the relevant data. The context provides pre-tax catastrophe losses for the years 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017.

From the context, we can see that the pre-tax catastrophe losses for the last three years (2016, 2017, and 2018) are not explicitly provided. However, we can calculate the total pre-tax catastrophe losses for the years 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016.

The pre-tax catastrophe losses for these years are as follows:

- 2012: $410.0 million
- 2013: $194.0 million
- 2014: $56.3 million
- 2015: $53.8 million
- 2016: $301.2 million

To find the total pre-tax catastrophe losses for these five years, we can add these values together:

Total pre-tax catastrophe losses = $410.0 million + $194.0 million + $56.3 million + $53.8 million + $301.2 million

Total pre-tax catastrophe losses = $1015.3 million

Therefore, the total pre-tax catastrophe losses in the last three years (2012, 2013, and 2014) are $1015.3 million.

To calculate the percentage change in the total fair value of restricted stock and performance awards vested from 2016 to 2017, we need to find the fair value of restricted stock and performance awards vested in 2016 and 2017.

Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain the necessary information to calculate the percentage change in the total fair value of restricted stock and performance awards vested from 2016 to 2017. The context provides information about the assumptions used in the Monte Carlo lattice pricing model, the weighted average grant date fair value of performance-based restricted stock units granted during the years 2008 and 2007, the total fair value of performance-based restricted stock units vested during 2009, 2008, and 2007, and other information about restricted stock units and performance awards. However, it does not provide the fair value of restricted stock and performance awards vested in 2016 and 2017.

To calculate the growth rate in other assets from 2008 to 2009, we can use the formula:

growth_rate = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values from the table in the context:

old_value = 2,165,290 (other assets as of November 28, 2008)
new_value = 19,1265 (other assets as of November 27, 2009)

growth_rate = ((19,1265 - 2,165,290) / 2,165,290) * 100

growth_rate = (-1,146,025 / 2,165,290) * 100

growth_rate = -0.529 * 100

growth_rate = -52.9%

Therefore, the growth rate in other assets from 2008 to 2009 is -52.9%.

To calculate the percentage of global berths that came from Royal Caribbean in 2013, we need to find the total number of berths marketed globally and the number of berths marketed by Royal Caribbean in 2013.

From the table data provided, we can see that the total number of berths marketed globally in 2013 was 432,000 and the number of berths marketed by Royal Caribbean was 98,750.

To find the percentage, we can use the formula:

percentage = (Royal Caribbean berths / Total global berths) * 100

Substituting the given values:

percentage = (98750 / 432000) * 100

percentage = 0.0229 * 100

percentage = 2.29%

Therefore, the percentage of global berths that came from Royal Caribbean in 2013 is 2.29%.

To find the percentage of global cruise guests that are not from North America or Europe, we need to first calculate the total number of global cruise guests and then subtract the number of cruise guests from North America and Europe.

From the table in the context, we can see that the global cruise guests in 2016 were 240,000. The number of cruise guests from North America in 2016 was 12,581,000, and the number of cruise guests from Europe in 2016 was 6,542,000.

First, let's calculate the total number of cruise guests from North America and Europe:

Total cruise guests from North America and Europe = Cruise guests from North America + Cruise guests from Europe
= 12,581,000 + 6,542,000
= 19,123,000

Now, let's calculate the number of cruise guests that are not from North America or Europe:

Cruise guests not from North America or Europe = Total global cruise guests - Total cruise guests from North America and Europe
= 24,000,000 - 19,123,000
= 4,877,000

Finally, let's calculate the percentage of global cruise guests that are not from North America or Europe:

Percentage of cruise guests not from North America or Europe = (Cruise guests not from North America or Europe / Total global cruise guests) * 100
= (4,877,000 / 24,000,000) * 100
= 0.203125 * 100
= 20.3125%

Therefore, the percentage of global cruise guests that are not from North America or Europe is approximately 20.31%.

To find the decrease in asset retirement obligations from 2007 to 2008, we need to look at the change in the asset retirement obligations as of December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, from the provided table.

From the table, we can see that the asset retirement obligations as of January 1, 2008, were $1,134 million, and as of December 31, 2008, they were $965 million.

To find the decrease, we subtract the asset retirement obligations as of December 31, 2008, from the asset retirement obligations as of January 1, 2008:

$1,134 million - $965 million = $169 million

Therefore, the asset retirement obligations decreased by $169 million from 2007 to 2008.

Generation: <REASONING>
To determine the portion of the expected payments within the next 12 months allocated to the repayment of long-term debt, we need to analyze the provided table of contractual obligations. The table shows the payments due by period, including the next 12 months (fiscal 2020), for long-term debt, operating leases, capital leases, purchase obligations, and other obligations.

From the table, we can see that the total payments due by period for the next 12 months (fiscal 2020) are $23,778.5 million. This includes:

- Long-term debt (including current portion, excluding capital lease obligations): $550.8 million
- Operating lease obligations: $214.3 million
- Capital lease obligations: $6.4 million
- Purchase obligations and other: $16,007.0 million

To find the portion allocated to the repayment of long-term debt, we need to divide the long-term debt payments by the total payments due by period for the next 12 months.

Portion allocated to long-term debt repayment = (Long-term debt payments / Total payments due by period for the next 12 months) * 100

Portion allocated to long-term debt repayment = ($550.8 million / $23,778.5 million) * 100

Portion allocated to long-term debt repayment = 2.32%

Therefore, approximately 2.32% of the expected payments within the next 12 months is allocated to the repayment of long-term debt.

Generation: <REASONING>
To calculate the balance of long-term debt after 1 year, we need to consider the maturity requirements on long-term debt as of December 31, 2018, and the credit facility provided by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders and other agents.

From the table provided, the maturity requirements on long-term debt as of December 31, 2018, by year are as follows:

Years ending December 31:
2019: $124,176
2020: $15,979,000
2021: $19,584,800
2022: $26,758,700
2023: $39,450,530
2024 and thereafter: $47,500,000
Total: $51,767,406

The credit facility provided for secured financing comprised of:

- A $1.5 billion revolving credit facility
- A $1.5 billion term loan (the term A loan)
- A $1.37 billion term loan (the term A-2 loan)
- A $1.14 billion term loan facility (the term B-2 loan)
- A $500 million term loan (the term B-4 loan)

The term A loan and the term A-2 loan mature, and the revolving credit facility expires, on January 20, 2023.
The term B-2 loan matures on April 22, 2023.
The term B-4 loan matures on October 18, 2025.

The principal amounts for each loan are as follows:

- Term A loan: $1,500,000,000
- Term A-2 loan: $1,370,000,000
- Term B-2 loan: $1,140,000,000
- Term B-4 loan: $500,000,000

To calculate the balance of long-term debt after 1 year, we need to subtract the principal amount of the loans that will be paid off in the next year from the total long-term debt.

The principal amount of the loans that will be paid off in 2019 is $124,176.

Therefore, the balance of long-term debt after 1 year will be:

$51,767,406 - $124,176 = $51,643,230

To find the net change in cash in millions for 2019, we need to look at the net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities for 2019 and subtract the net cash used in investing activities and add the net cash provided by (used in) financing activities from the net cash provided by operating activities.

From the provided context, we can see that the net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 was $565.1 million, and in 2017, it was $881.8 million. However, the context does not provide the net cash provided by operating activities for 2019.

We can also see that the net cash used in investing activities in 2018 was -$24,915.5 million, and in 2017, it was -$196.2 million. However, the context does not provide the net cash used in investing activities for 2019.

We can also see that the net cash provided by (used in) financing activities in 2018 was $18,532.2 million, and in 2017, it was -$1,004.9 million. However, the context does not provide the net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for 2019.

Since the context does not provide the necessary information for 2019, we cannot calculate the net change in cash in millions for 2019.

--------------------------------------------------
Generation: <REASONING>
To calculate the percentage decline in the total restricted cash and marketable securities from 2011 to 2012, we need to first find the total restricted cash and marketable securities for both years. However, the provided context does not contain the necessary information for the year 2011 or 2012. Therefore, we cannot calculate the percentage decline.

However, we can find the total restricted cash and marketable securities for the year 2009 from the context. The total restricted cash and marketable securities at the beginning of 2009 is not provided, but the non-vested restricted stock awards at the end of 2008 is $518,000 with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $39. 

We also need to find the total restricted cash and marketable securities for the year 2010. The context does not provide the total restricted cash and marketable securities for 2010, but it does provide information about the net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities, and net cash used in financing activities for 2010.

Since we cannot calculate the percentage decline in the total restricted cash and marketable securities from 2011 to 2012, we cannot provide a final answer.

To calculate the percentage change in revenues for investments in 50% or less owned investments accounted for using the equity method between 2000 and 2001, we need to find the revenues for 2000 and 2001 and then apply the percentage change formula.

However, the provided context does not contain the revenues for 2000 and 2001 for investments in 50% or less owned investments accounted for using the equity method. Therefore, we cannot calculate the percentage change in revenues for these investments between 2000 and 2001.

The context provided contains information about the revenues for the investing & lending segment for the years 2011, 2012, and 2013, but it does not contain the revenues for the years 2000 and 2001.

To calculate the percentual decrease observed in the future minimum rental payments during 2008 and 2009, we can use the formula:

percentage_decrease = ((old_value - new_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 317,000,000 (2008)
new_value = 275,000,000 (2009)

percentage_decrease = ((275,000,000 - 317,000,000) / 317,000,000) * 100

percentage_decrease = (-42,000,000 / 317,000,000) * 100

percentage_decrease = -0.1324 * 100

percentage_decrease = -13.24%

Therefore, the percentual decrease observed in the future minimum rental payments during 2008 and 2009 is -13.24%.

To calculate the difference in cumulative percentage returns between Edwards Lifesciences and the S&P 500 for the five years ended 2016, we need to first calculate the cumulative percentage returns for both Edwards Lifesciences and the S&P 500 for the given period.

From the provided context, we have the following data for Edwards Lifesciences and the S&P 500:

Edwards Lifesciences:
- 2011: $127.54
- 2012: $93.01
- 2013: $180.17
- 2014: $223.42
- 2015: $265.06
- 2016: $265.06

S&P 500:
- 2011: $116.00
- 2012: $153.58
- 2013: $174.60
- 2014: $177.01
- 2015: $185.00
- 2016: $198.18

To calculate the cumulative percentage returns, we can use the formula:

cumulative_percentage_return = (1 + (yearly_return / initial_investment)) ^ number_of_years

Substituting the given values:

initial_investment = $100
number_of_years = 5

For Edwards Lifesciences:

cumulative_percentage_return_edwards = (1 + (127.54 / 100)) ^ 5
cumulative_percentage_return_edwards = (1.2754) ^ 5
cumulative_percentage_return_edwards = 6.219

For S&P 500:

cumulative_percentage_return_sp500 = (1 + (116.00 / 100)) ^ 5
cumulative_percentage_return_sp500 = (1.16) ^ 5
cumulative_percentage_return_sp500 = 2.016

Now, we can calculate the difference in cumulative percentage returns:

difference = cumulative_percentage_return_edwards - cumulative_percentage_return_sp500
difference = 6.219 - 2.016
difference = 4.203

Therefore, the difference in cumulative percentage returns between Edwards Lifesciences and the S&P 500 for the five years ended 2016 is 4.203 or 420.3%.

To calculate the increase in annual payments from 2019 to 2024 and beyond, we need to compare the payments due by period for these years from the table provided in the context.

From the table, we can see that the total payments due by period for 2019 to 2024 and beyond are as follows:

- Fiscal 2020: $23,778.5 million
- Fiscal 2021 and 2022: $15,574.4 million
- Fiscal 2023 and 2024: $28,975.5 million
- Thereafter: $62,735.5 million

To find the increase in annual payments from 2019 to 2024, we can subtract the total payments due by period for 2021 and 2022 from the total payments due by period for 2020 and 2021, and then divide by 2 (since it's a 2-year period). However, this is not the correct approach as it does not account for the payments due in 2020 and 2021. Instead, we should compare the payments due by period for 2020 and 2021 with the payments due by period for 2023 and 2024.

The increase in annual payments from 2021 to 2024 is the difference between the total payments due by period for 2023 and 2024 and the total payments due by period for 2021 and 2022, divided by 2. However, this is still not the correct approach as it does not account for the payments due in 2021 and 2022. Instead, we should compare the payments due by period for 2021 and 2022 with the payments due by period for 2023 and 2024.

The correct approach is to calculate the increase in annual payments from 2021 to 2024 by subtracting the total payments due by period for 2021 and 2022 from the total payments due by period for 2023 and 2024.

Increase in annual payments from 2021 to 2024 = (Total payments due by period for 2023 and 2024 - Total payments due by period for 2021 and 2022) / 2

Increase in annual payments from 2021 to 2024 = ($28,975.5 million - $15,574.4 million) / 2

Increase in annual payments from 2021 to 2024 = $13,700.55 million / 2

Increase in annual payments from 2021 to 2024 = $6,850.275 million

To find the percentage increase, we can divide the increase in annual payments from 2021 to 2024 by the total payments due by period for 2021 and 2022, and then multiply by 100.

Percentage increase from 2021 to 2024 = (Increase in annual payments from 2021 to 2024 / Total payments due by period for 2021 and 2022) * 100

Percentage increase from 2021 to 2024 = ($6,850.275 million / $15,574.4 million) * 100

Percentage increase from 2021 to 2024 = 0.4397 * 100

Percentage increase from 2021 to 2024 = 43.97%

Therefore, the annual payments increased by 43.97% from 2021 to 2024.

To find the increase in annual payments from 2019 to 2024, we can subtract the total payments due by period for 2021 and 2022 from the total payments due by period for 2020 and 2021, and then divide by 2 (since it's a 2-year period).

Increase in annual payments from 2019 to 2024 = (Total payments due by period for 2020 and 2021 - Total payments due by period for 2021 and 2022) / 2

Increase in annual payments from 2019 to 2024 = ($23,778.5 million - $15,574.4 million) / 2

Increase in annual payments from 2019 to 2024 = $8,204.1 million / 2

Increase in annual payments from 2019 to 2024 = $4,102.05 million

To find the percentage increase, we can divide the increase in annual payments from 2019 to 2024 by the total payments due by period for 2020 and 2021, and then multiply by 100.

Percentage increase from 2019 to 2024 = (Increase in annual payments from 2019 to 2024 / Total payments due by period for 2020 and 2021) * 100

Percentage increase from 2019 to 2024 = ($4,102.05 million / $23,778.5 million) * 100

Percentage increase from 2019 to 2024 = 0.1725 * 100

Percentage increase from 2019 to 2024 = 17.25%

Therefore, the annual payments increased by 17.25% from 2019 to 2024.

To calculate the percentage change in the balance of asset allocation from 2016 to 2017, we need to compare the asset allocation percentages for each asset class in 2016 and 2017. However, the provided context does not directly give us the asset allocation percentages for 2016. We can find the asset allocation percentages for 2017 in the context, but we need to look for information about the asset allocation percentages for 2016 in other parts of the context.

Upon reviewing the context, we find that the asset allocation percentages for 2016 are not explicitly stated. However, we can infer that the asset allocation percentages for 2016 are not provided in the given context.

Therefore, we cannot calculate the percentage change in the balance of asset allocation from 2016 to 2017 based on the provided context.

To calculate the average yearly amortization expense related to trademarks, we need to find the total amortization expense for trademarks over the given years and then divide it by the number of years.

From the context, we can see that the weighted average useful life of trademarks is 7 years. However, we do not have the total amortization expense for trademarks over the given years. We can find the total amortization expense for intangible assets over the given years, but we cannot separate the expense for trademarks.

The total amortization expense for intangible assets for the years 2016, 2015, and 2014 is $13.0 million, $13.9 million, and $8.5 million, respectively. However, we do not have the breakdown of these expenses by type of intangible asset.

We also have a table showing the estimated amortization expense for the company's intangible assets as of December 31, 2016, but it does not provide the actual amortization expense for trademarks.

Therefore, we cannot calculate the average yearly amortization expense related to trademarks based on the provided context.

To calculate the 5-year return of the KBW Bank Index, we can use the formula for compound annual growth rate (CAGR):

CAGR = (end_value / start_value)^(1 / number_of_years) - 1

From the provided context, we have the following data for the KBW Bank Index:

start_value = 100 (in 2008)
end_value = 168 (in 2013)
number_of_years = 5

Substituting the given values into the formula:

CAGR = (168 / 100)^(1 / 5) - 1

CAGR = (1.68)^(1 / 5) - 1

CAGR = 1.084 - 1

CAGR = 0.084

CAGR = 8.4%

Therefore, the 5-year return of the KBW Bank Index is 8.4%.

To calculate the change in millions between 2015 and 2016 of foreign currency transaction gains (losses) for AES Corporation, we can directly read the relevant data from the provided context.

From the context, we have the following data for AES Corporation:

- In 2015, the foreign currency transaction gain was $31 million.
- In 2016, the foreign currency transaction loss was $50 million.

To find the change in millions between 2015 and 2016, we subtract the 2015 value from the 2016 value:

Change = 2016 value - 2015 value
Change = -$50 million - $31 million
Change = -$81 million

Therefore, the change in millions between 2015 and 2016 of foreign currency transaction gains (losses) for AES Corporation is -$81 million.

To find the change in millions between 2014 and 2015 of foreign currency transaction gains (losses) for AES Corporation, we need to look at the provided context, specifically the table that shows foreign currency transaction gains (losses) for each year.

From the table, we can see that the foreign currency transaction gains (losses) for AES Corporation in millions were as follows:

- 2014: -$34 (34)
- 2015: -$31 (31)

To find the change in millions between 2014 and 2015, we subtract the 2015 value from the 2014 value:

Change = 2014 value - 2015 value
Change = -34 - (-31)
Change = -34 + 31
Change = -3

Therefore, the change in millions between 2014 and 2015 of foreign currency transaction gains (losses) for AES Corporation is -$3 million.

To calculate the percentage change in the company's warranty liability from 2011 to 2012, we need to find the difference in the beginning and ending accrued warranty and related costs for 2011 and 2012, and then divide that by the beginning accrued warranty and related costs for 2011, and multiply by 100.

From the provided context, we can see that the beginning accrued warranty and related costs for 2011 is $188 million and the ending accrued warranty and related costs for 2011 is $230 million. However, there is no information provided for the beginning and ending accrued warranty and related costs for 2012.

Generation: <REASONING>
To calculate the percentage growth in revenues from 2007 to 2008, we can use the formula:

percentage_growth = ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100

Substituting the given values:

old_value = 2007 revenue
new_value = 2008 revenue

From the context, we can find the revenue for 2007 and 2008. However, the context does not provide the exact revenue figures for 2007 and 2008. We can find the total revenue for 2007 and 2008 in the context, but it is not clear if the total revenue includes all the components of revenue or just the core revenue. Therefore, we cannot calculate the percentage growth in revenues from 2007 to 2008 using the given context.
