discussed below , gross margin in 2001 was unusually low resulting from negative gross margin of 2% ( 2 % ) experienced in the first quarter of 2001 .\\nas a percentage of net sales , the company\\'s quarterly gross margins declined during fiscal 2002 from 31% ( 31 % ) in the first quarter down to 26% ( 26 % ) in the fourth quarter .\\nthis decline resulted from several factors including a rise in component costs as the year progressed and aggressive pricing by the company across its products lines instituted as a result of continued pricing pressures in the personal computer industry .\\nthe company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer industry will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2003 in light of weak economic conditions , flat demand for personal computers in general , and the resulting pressure on prices .\\nthe foregoing statements regarding anticipated gross margin in 2003 and the general demand for personal computers

may affect future results and financial condition.\" there can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained , targeted gross margin levels will be achieved , or current margins on existing individual products will be maintained .\\nin general , gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors , including continued industry wide global pricing pressures , increased competition , compressed product life cycles , potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services , and potential changes to the company\\'s product mix , including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins .\\nin response to these downward pressures , the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products .\\ngross margins could also be affected by the company\\'s ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products .\\nthe company\\'s operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time ; however , the company\\'s results of operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates .\\nthe company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments .\\nbecause the company\\'s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes , there is a risk

claim adjustment expenses include case reserves for reported claims and reserves for claims incurred but not reported ( ibnr ) .\\nwhile payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to insurance policies issued by the company , the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case reserves and ibnr is an estimate , subject to significant uncertainty .\\nthe actual amount to be paid is not determined until the company reaches a settlement with the claimant .\\nfinal claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates , particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future .\\nin estimating the timing of future payments by year , the company has assumed that its historical payment patterns will continue .\\nhowever , the actual timing of future payments will likely vary materially from these estimates due to , among other things , changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements .\\nin particular , there is significant uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of asbestos and environmental claims .\\nalso , estimated payments in 2005 do not include payments that will be made on claims incurred in 2005 on policies that were in force as of december 31 , 2004 .\\nin addition , the table does not include future cash flows related to the receipt of premiums that will be used , in part , to fund loss payments .\\nunder generally accepted accounting principles , the company is only permitted to discount reserves for claim and claim adjustment expenses in cases where the payment pattern and ultimate loss costs are fixed and reliably determinable on an individual claim basis .\\nfor the company , these include claim settlements with

and financial condition.\" backlog in the company\\'s experience , the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects .\\nin particular , backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of over- ordering by dealers anticipating shortages .\\nbacklog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply .\\nbecause of the foregoing , backlog cannot be considered a reliable indicator of the company\\'s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance .\\nfurther information regarding the company\\'s backlog may be found below under the heading \"factors that may affect future results and financial condition.\" gross margin gross margin for the three fiscal years ended september 28 , 2002 are as follows ( in millions , except gross margin percentages ) : gross margin increased to 28% ( 28 % ) of net sales in 2002 from 23% ( 23 % ) in 2001 .\\nas discussed below , gross margin in 2001 was unusually low resulting from negative gross margin of 2% ( 2 % ) experienced in the first quarter of 2001 .\\nas a percentage of net sales , the company\\'s quarterly gross margins declined during fiscal 2002 from 31% ( 31 % ) in the first quarter down to 26% ( 26 % ) in the fourth quarter .\\nthis decline resulted from several factors including a rise in component costs as the year progressed and aggressive pricing by the company across its products lines instituted as a result of continued pricing pressures in the personal computer industry .\\nthe company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer industry will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2003 in light of weak economic conditions , flat demand for personal computers in general , and the resulting pressure on prices .\\nthe foregoing statements regarding anticipated gross margin in 2003 and the general demand for personal computers during 2003 are forward- looking .\\ngross margin could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors , including certain of those set forth below in the subsection entitled \"factors that may affect future results and financial condition.\" there can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained , targeted gross margin levels will be achieved , or current margins on existing individual products will be maintained .\\nin general , gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors , including continued industry wide global pricing pressures , increased competition , compressed product life cycles , potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services , and potential changes to the company\\'s product mix , including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins .\\nin response to these downward pressures , the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products .\\ngross margins could also be affected by the company\\'s ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products .\\nthe company\\'s operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time ; however , the company\\'s results of operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates .\\nthe company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments .\\nbecause the company\\'s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes , there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components .\\nthe company\\'s operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company\\'s ability to manage
