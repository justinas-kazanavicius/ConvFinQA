14 % ) from fiscal 2007 .\\nall revenue components within the segment experienced growth during fiscal 2008 .\\nlicense revenue generated the largest dollar growth in revenue as episys ae , our flagship core processing system aimed at larger credit unions , experienced strong sales throughout the year .\\nsupport and service revenue , which is the largest component of total revenues for the credit union segment , experienced 34 percent growth in eft support and 10 percent growth in in-house support .\\ngross profit in this business segment increased $ 9344 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 , due primarily to the increase in license revenue , which carries the highest margins .\\nliquidity and capital resources we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and short-term borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements .\\nwe expect this trend to continue in the future

for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2009 as compared to $ 181001 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2008 .\\nthis increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in receivables compared to the same period a year ago of $ 21214 .\\nthis decrease is largely the result of fiscal 2010 annual software maintenance billings being provided to customers earlier than in the prior year , which allowed more cash to be collected before the end of the fiscal year than in previous years .\\nfurther , we collected more cash overall related to revenues that will be recognized in subsequent periods in the current year than in fiscal 2008 .\\ncash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2009 was $ 59227 and includes $ 3027 in contingent consideration paid on prior years 2019 acquisitions .\\ncash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2008 was $ 102148 and includes payments for acquisitions of $ 48109 , plus $ 1215 in contingent consideration paid on prior years 2019 acquisitions .\\ncapital expenditures for fiscal 2009 were $ 31562 compared to $ 31105 for fiscal 2008 .\\ncash used for software development in fiscal 2009 was $ 24684 compared to $

of dividends of $ 26903 and $ 13489 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities .\\ncash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 3773 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock ( through the employee stock purchase plan ) and $ 348 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises .\\nduring fiscal 2008 , net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year was $ 101905 and includes the repurchase of 4200 shares of our common stock for $ 100996 , the payment of dividends of $ 24683 and $ 429 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities .\\ncash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 20394 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock and $ 3809 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises .\\nbeginning during fiscal 2008 , us financial markets and many of the largest us financial institutions have been shaken by negative developments in the home mortgage industry and the mortgage markets , and particularly the markets for subprime mortgage-backed securities .\\nsince that time , these and other such developments have resulted in a broad , global economic downturn .\\nwhile we , as is the case with most companies , have experienced the effects of this downturn , we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collection efforts , and we believe that any future impact to our liquidity will be minimized by cash generated by recurring sources of revenue and due to our access to available lines of credit. .\\n\\nTable Data:\\n2008\\tyear ended

      "Generation: Based on the table, we can see that the balance of cash flow hedges in OCI before reclassifications was $52.7 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "After reclassifications, the balance decreased to -193.4 (193.4) as per table headers but when values are compared to the line directly beneath the \"reclassifications\" line for 2013, it is clear that cash flow hedges amount had already been significantly impacted by re-classification and was then $29.8 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we're asked about percentage change from the original number of $52.7 and $-30.6 (this is likely a typo within an additional parenthesis in which case this may refer to reclassification related to defined benefits), let's focus on 52.7 which had -305.2(305.2)value before being re-classified, while cash flow hedge reclassification was impacted by itself. We'll treat its difference as standalone in terms of calculation.\n",
      "We therefore calculate a percentage change for $29.8 from $52.7:\n",

      "($29.8 / $52.7) * 100 = -56.5%\n",
      "\n",
      "The negative value indicates that $52.7 decreased to $29.8, which is an equivalent to reducing itself by approximately 43% (or you could think of it as a reduction), the opposite sign would have made this question about \"cash flow from hedges  increased\" where we'd consider finding positive percentage change however cash flow hedging had been diminished.\n",
      "However, when considering whether one should focus solely on the cash flow hedge line and just do the math (for the sake of clarity): that would be an increase by -56.5 percent or more colloquially put, 56.5% reduction\n",
